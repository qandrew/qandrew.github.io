      <description>Hi all! I thought I&amp;rsquo;d update y&amp;rsquo;all with some of my recent readings/watchings on the internet.
Business Articles  Behind the Big Promises of the Micromobility Industry | CityLab What is the future of transportation? While there is industry hype on self-driving cars, I personally believe that micromobility (dockless bikes and scooters) are the nearer term solution. Fyre: The Greatest Party that Never Happened | Netflix This Netflix documentary, along with Hulu&amp;rsquo;s take on the Fyre festival, is an introspective take on a failed music festival in 2017 and the lead-up to the disaster.</description>

      <description>I should probably be writing my thesis for my MEng, but I&amp;rsquo;ll start off kindling the writing part of my mind by procrastinating for a bit.
In the past year after I completed my undergraduate degree, I&amp;rsquo;ve been slowing spending more time finding more about who I am. During the MIT undergraduate semesters, which was one of the best times of my life, I had a lot on my plate, from rushing problem set deadline to photography event to party &amp;ndash;it was the work-hard, play-hard lifestyle.</description>

      <description>I keep a journal entry to write down my thoughts and also my day to day life (who I hang out with, where I eat etc), though recently I decided to also start keeping track of my digital history, a series of links of articles / websites that I&amp;rsquo;ve found interesting. Here are some that I&amp;rsquo;d like to share.
Transit Articles  Why Is American Mass Transit So Bad? It&amp;rsquo;s a Long Story | CityLab: this is a good CityLab article about the history of public transit in the US, it&amp;rsquo;s rise in the early 20th century, and its demise as automobiles became more prevalent in this country in the ensuing decades.</description>

      <title>Thoughts on Urban Planning and Such</title>

      <description>Hello, and I guess I am back to [attempting to] blogging. I thought I&amp;rsquo;d try to consolidate my thoughts and interests on urban planning and related topics in this blog post. Growing up, I&amp;rsquo;ve always had an interest in transportation related topics. Whether it be city planning, trains (mass transit or high-speed rail), airplanes, or cars, my interests have drifted in and out of these areas.

      <title>6.875 Cryptography &amp; Cryptanalysis Lecture Videos</title>

      <description>During the Spring 2018 Semester, I took Vinod Vaikuntanathan and Shafi Goldwasser&amp;rsquo;s Cryptography &amp;amp; Cryptanalysis (6.875) class. I filmed all but one lecture (oops I lost the video on MPC somwhere in the middle of class), providing a resource for current and future students to access the wonderful lectures. You can view the playlist here. The first recorded lecture is embedded below.
  Selected Press The lecture videos were featured on Hacker News.</description>

      <title>Tips on Basic Financial Management</title>

      <description>Continuing from my previous post on credit cards, I&amp;rsquo;ll detail some of my money management habits that might be helpful for others.
Here, I&amp;rsquo;ll talk about opening bank accounts, maximizing rewards, and some basic investment tips.
Bank Accounts  Open a savings account like GS Bank and earn 1.2% interest every year.
 If you do not have a bank account, I would definitely recommend getting one. It&amp;rsquo;s nice to have money stored in a bank rather than having to carry cash around, make purchases on the internet, and certain banks also offer nice interest rates so your money will grow by just sitting there.</description>

      <description>Hello, this is my first blog post in a while :) I&amp;rsquo;ll keep to a minimalist writing style so reading this blog can be as fast and as helpful as possible.
Credit Cards A credit card is a payment system. When you use a credit card to buy an item, you are effectively borrowing money from the bank, and you can pay the bank back within a subsequent 25-30 day period.</description>

      <title>Leakage Resilient Public Key Authentication for Embedded Devices</title>

      <description>For my senior year at MIT, I participated in the MIT SuperUROP program as a MITRE Undergraduate Research and Innovation Scholar. My research topic was Implementing Leakage Resilient, Public Key Authentication Systems for Embedded Devices, working with Chiraag Juvekar and Prof. Anantha Chandrakasan.
This work was presented at EECScon. An extension of this work, with my collaborators, is currently in submission.
Abstract Having an effective and convenient authentication system is necessary for the future development and increased usage of devices in the Internet of Things.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Lightning</title>

      <description>For our 6.857 (network security) final project, in a group project with Jamie Bloxham, Gina Yuan, and Justine Jang, we implemented probabilistic payments on the bitcoin lightning project. The bitcoin lightning is a peer-to-peer system that allows transactions between parties to be conducted off the main blockchain, reducing transaction costs.
Abstract With regular Bitcoin transactions, low-value, high-frequency payments are increasingly impractical due to increasingly significant mining fees that must be paid with each transaction.</description>

      <description>Context For our final project for the Distributed Systems Class at MIT (6.824), we have successfully implemented a command line interface text editor, such that multiple clients can collaborate on a single document and attain eventual consistency in the document through the use of operational transforms.
View our paper on our implementation here.

      <description>Context Along with MIT Student Cable, I helped film MIT&amp;rsquo;s Musical Theater Guild (MTG)&amp;rsquo;s IAP 2017 production of Hack, Punt, Tool, which is an original musical about a fictional group of MIT students working on building a Hack at MIT.

      <title>Learning Digits via Audio-Visual Representations</title>
      <link>/post/6.867/</link>

      <description>Abstract Our goal is to explore models for language learning (in this case learning numerical digits in their spoken and visual representations) in the manner that humans learn languages as children. Namely, children do not have intermediary text transcriptions in corresponding visual and audio inputs from the world around them; rather, they directly make connections between what they see and what they hear. In this paper, we construct models for the direct bi-directional classification of speech and images, inspired by a few research papers.</description>

      <description>Context During the summer of 2016, I made a series of vlogs documenting my travels through Asia. My friend Jingyi Zhao and I took a one week trip to Thailand before heading to Tokyo for a week to participate in the MUSCAT program organized by the university of Tokyo. Here are four videos that I made documenting the trip.
1. Flight to Thailand   2. Bangkok   3.</description>

      <title>3D Tic Tac Toe AI</title>

      <description>For my final project, I built a 3D Tic Tac Toe game, complete with an AI for the user to play against. The input of the game used capacitave based sensing chips, and the output of the game was displayed on a VGA screen. I used my 8051 and R31JP to connect with my PSoC to process the user input and game engine.

      <description>During the Spring 2016 Semester, I took Ankur Moitra&amp;rsquo;s Advanced Algorithms (6.854) class. With the help of my friends Sitara Persad and Shraman Ray Chaudhuri, we filmed all but two lectures, providing a resource for current and future students to access Prof. Moitra&amp;rsquo;s wonderful lectures.

      <title>MIT Sophomore Mixer Series</title>

      <description>Over IAP 2015 (MIT Speak for our January break), Justine Jang and I worked with Fred Daso and the MIT 2017 Class Council on the Mixer Series project as a way to connect MIT sophomores with each other.
What we did MIT is a very diverse community, but students are very busy. So how does one meet new people outside of her daily life cycle of classes, clubs, psetting, and her friend group?</description>
