                  How many entries will I get to write <i>on a train in China?</i>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The train is one of the purest purist forms of transportation, the one that defined and still defines transportation in China.
                  Even though the Chinese government has probably put in special effort to clean up the countryside in an effort for it to appear
                  beautiful. We may be traveling through fake farms -the real standard living is below what we appear to see -as according to
                  斯衡舅公, and that the "real" farms, the real "normal" of the Chinese motherland is something less classy, less materialistic,
                  and less acceptable in the meta.
                </p>
                <p>
                  But there is still so much tradition. This heritage is what I'm pursuing, this cultural reality that we all idolize and
                  make so magical, because this is how it was and this is the way it is supposed to be. It is still real: these tracks are the
                  ones our fathers (but probably not grandfathers) rode on. Through the country we head in an attempt to find some amount of
                  closure on who I am and where I come from. We are already traveling in 软卧 (first class); but by the Western Eye you really
                  can't say much about its luxury. What you can hold onto is the culture -cultured to a point that you know so well, so so well,
                  that it is in you, that there is no point of refreshing your memory because these memories will reverberate in your
                  heart ceaselessly through time.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We see the old factories that have rusted, the countryside filled with corn and rice plants, the pagodas on mountains upon mountains.
                  But also, we see how far we've come. The high speed dedicated rail running parallel to our train track (昆明-大理) is nearing
                  completion. Paved roads with cars, basketball courts in local elementary schools. Talk about penetration, talk about the
                  amount of change -and utter disregard to time -that has taken place in just a generation. And imagine what will be in our
                  lifetimes, what we will gain -and what we will lose.
                </p>
                <p>
                  And nine years ago, July 2004 was the last time I was in this kind of traditional Chinese rolling stock. From Beijing to Hong Kong.
                  I have had many good train experiences since that too. Japan, another homeland of rail transportation. The Sunrise Express we took
                  to Shikoku, another overnight train that I have taken. Now in a 软卧 once again, there is something special about this train, something
                  that I feel deep in my heart. Something sentimental is here, something that transcends the mediocre conditions. But with my Western
                  Eye can I truly appreciate its beauty? Is the beauty about white cover sheets turning grey, dust settling on cloth hangers, oriental toilets
                  and floors covered with water?
                </p>
                <p>
                  Does this materialism even matter?
                </p>
                <p>
                  And I write this down to preserve the thought of the moment in my memory. Pictures can capture the visual moment for memory.
                  The new sound & shot on my Korean piece of shit can capture an auditory sensory too. Film to preserve sound and sight. We bring
                  food back for smell and taste. Maybe in the future we can create a device that can capture those two senses for memory. But why
                  capture everything in its exact way, storing everything as static memories, instead of allowing our mind to ebb and flow and carve
                  out a fluid image of what was. Like KG.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> Set your imagination free, devoid of inhibitors.
                </p>
                <p>
                  What is so sentimental about the past? Maybe we feel a sense of identity, a sense of belonging, and a sense of home, something that
                  we can refer back to when we are lost. The future is something that no one can predict perfectly, although it's uncertainty
                  creates an imperfect balance. In the past we are limited by facts and opinions and bias, in the future we may be limited by the trend.
                  But the present -also limited by the trend -I guess I can control a certain amount of what I want. I want to do whatever I please ...
                  <sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> I want to be a cowboy out west, a figure that represents the heart of American individualism,
                  although we know that ideal is far from reality, compromised through cultural synthesis.
                </p>
                <p>
                  But we still feel an amount of responsibility, an amount of security, and amount of longing for the good old days that once was
                  but probably never will be. But those are on the back end of the trend -the "successful" ones are always on the front end. And
                  the past is always in us, and we can feel the power of the throwback -Kelly showing me the AA Airlines Plane that I drew for
                  杨老师 back in 2008. The vivid image of what I was hit me like a deer in the headlights.
                </p>
                <p>
                  But we move forward. Until we can control time (we can somewhat control people), we move forward. And in modern culture, we
                  mainstream so hard and high-culture penetrates so hard (iPhones in the most random town in China, Japanese T-Shirts in country
                  music videos -what else is more American??) the era that we live in is so, so transient. Welcome to the twenty first century, bitch.
                </p>
                <p>
                  And as we move forward, we gain stuff. But what do we lose? The Boeing 747, the icon of the aviation industry, is struggling
                  to stay in production. We could go even before air travel and talk about the demise of ocean liners; only Queen Mary 2 exists.
                  We can be excited about the 777-9X because it will be a great product, but let's take a moment and appreciate the work of our
                  fathers. [And then continue grinding in the trend]. Chinese dialects, old big family empires. Naturally aspirated engines in
                  BMW M models. And what will we lose? Male-dominance, further pussification with medical/safety/legal improvements inhibiting our
                  lives, making us so wimpy to take a step out of the good life and that path?
                </p>
                <p>
                  But to be successful, you better catch the front end of the trend. Then the mainstream follows you. Then the sentimentalists
                  are left behind. Is there anything wrong with being left behind?
                </p>
                <p>
                  And so, America in it's conservative bubble, is still a great nation. But look at China and it's people, how hard they work.
                  The only difference between me and these people is the opportunity I have been given, so maybe I should feel a responsibility to
                  bring "better", or accelerate the future.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Maybe I can work on something else. Before I can completely judge America, I need to be able to understand this nation completely.
                  And I can go to the heartland. North Dakota, Colorado, maybe. The American Cowboy, what's more American than that? Hamburgers?
                  Facebook? And since I fantasize so much <sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup>, I might as well get the purest of them all.
                  Maybe I would be destroying what is left of the American past, but for simplicity I'll say I'm going there for scientific purposes.
                  And that I don't want to just follow the trend.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The only thing inhibiting me from going on this adventure is my balls, I wonder if I am willing to step out of the normal path.
                  中国合伙人：Do we change the world, or does the world change us? Maybe time will also stop me, just like how it has stopped my
                  interests in train tracks, Green Day, League of Legends...
                </p>
                <p>
                  We'll see. But if I can be a cowboy, then I can try to be a farmer in 新疆, or some really far away place. I need pain, I need
                  failure in my life. Maybe I'll find a ton of that at MIT. But I want to see how strong I am.
                </p>
                <p>
                  And I'll see if I will hold my word here, or will it be a "don't talk to " or "don't play League of Legends" situation,
                  where I fail at a personal level but succeed. Looking back, that really is the heart of second-handedness -and the scary part of
                  it is that for the adaptable and open minded Andrew Xia it didn't even hurt -and I need to be more firm and able to execute in my dreams.
                </p>
