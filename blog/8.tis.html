                  Last week, I went back to Tokyo International School, the school where I spent my formative years from fourth
                  to seventh grade learning and making friends who would eventually spread all over the world. My friends and I
                  gave a presentation to the current middle schoolers about our life after TIS, and what the school has meant to us.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If there is one thing that I've realized about my return,
                  it's that Tokyo -the city, the people, the memories, and the heart -is in me and will not ever
                  leave. It has been a while since I made it back, but I knew everything so well.
                  You can take me out of Tokyo, but you can't take Tokyo out of me.
                  I change, the world changes, but what is in me stays in me.

                <span class="caption text-muted">We appeared on the cover of TIS Times for the first time</span>

                <h3>TIS</h3>
                <p>
                  To give some context, I spent many years living in Tokyo when I was young; it is the city where I spent my childhood.
                  There, I attended a couple of international schools, the longest stay being at Tokyo International School. Looking back,
                  it was a very unique dynamic: as young kids we socialized in third-culture settings. For most families, like mine,
                  Tokyo was a temporary stop, so every year friends would come and go. Though seeming like a curse -it was common to see your
                  best friend one year move to another continent the next -it was also a blessing -as now I have people I care about all over the
                  world in Sweden, France, America, Australia, and so on.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Our family left Tokyo before I began high school. And in the six years since, I've only been back once. Now twice.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This time coming back, I contacted TIS teachers left, asking to stop by and say hi for the first time in a long time.
                  I was then invited by Kristine, one of the two teachers left from my TIS times, to come by the middle school and
                  give a presentation about life after Tokyo, my current college experience, and what the school has taught me.
                  Thus, with my good friends Julian and Caitlin, we went back to TIS one sleepy Tuesday morning.
                </p>
                <p>
                  And so we sat in front of the students wearing green and blue, and we began blabbering about where we are now, what we're
                  studying in college, and what we have done since TIS.
                  It was surreal being on the other side, as I know I once sat in the seats of the students I spoke to. We explained
                  how the fifth grade exhibition, the unit of inquiries that we did, were in hindsight very creative projects.
                  How our friendships have transcended continents and cultures, and how we still keep in touch.
                  Though never having met the current TIS students, I could relate to them. They are who I was, they will be where I am.
                  We all went through the same experiences that relate and bond us.

                <h3>What does it all mean to me?</h3>
                <p>
                  I know that I can't be in Tokyo forever. I have currently a college degree to attain, a present and future to pursue,
                  a future not about reliving an innocent ten year old lifestyle.
                  So as beautiful as reliving my nostalgie can be, the flow of time is incessant, the need to grow and change is necessary.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It's nice to relive old memories, but there is a reason why the past has passed. I am beginning to hypothesize that innocence is a currency.
                  For every time that I relive an moment, I layer a new experience, not as childish and as pure as what was, to my memory.
                  Tokyo is not only about growing up by Disney channel, but now also about the late nights of youth.
                  As I try to cash in and re-experience something from my youth, I add a new, not-so-young moment to the memory, which dilutes the purity.
                  Things don't stay innocent forever, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.
                </p>
                <p>
                  What makes a place important, and what makes the memories so meaningful? It's all about the subtleties -the sounds,
                  the smells, the slight behavioral habits -of what you remember.
                  I know so well the noise frequency of the Tokyu Oimachi line rolling stock as it begins to accelerate and depart from a station.
                  I know the taste of my favorite noodles in the city, 油そば (abura-soba), I know the sound of the summer cicadas by heart.
                  I can't live this Tokyo life forever, this meaning can not be consumed in my physical present forever -as I am writing this
                  entry I am already out of the country -but I know all, all too well.
                </p>
                <p>
                  So where am I heading now? I really don't know. Am I speeding forwards too quickly? I also don't know. Tokyo is not always at me,
                  but it is in me. Everyone has their identity, their heritage, that may not always be floating in their conscious mind, but
                  deep inside it always remains.
                </p>
