                  There is a certain something special about that last chairlift of the season. Sometimes,
                  it's really easy to tell when your ski season ends -late in the season, being busy with
                  other work, knowing that your only time on the mountain that season is in your trip out west.
                  Other times, like this season, I do not know how much more skiing I'll get in. But even so, it
                  was a bit surreal when I rode up the last red triple on West mountain with Johannes Norheim
                  and William Popov, slowly saying goodbye to my first racing season and bye to the Brown girls
                  that represent so many good things about this world, and returning to MIT, ready to take
                  on schoolwork and real life.
                <br><br>
                  Yesterday was my 30th day on the mountain, and this season was by far the most skiing I have ever
                  done in a winter. Just looking back, in winter 2014 we only skied for 5 days in our trip to Beaver
                  Creek/Vail, in 2013 we skied 6 days in our Whistler trip, in 2012 we skied for 5 days during our
                  to Snowbird/Utah with 正明叔叔 and with our cousins to Killington. In 2011, we skied
                  for 6 days, two in Killington and four at Beaver Creek, until I broke my wrist. In 2010, we skied
                  for a day at Sunapee, a day at Wachusett, and four days or so at Smuggler's Notch. And before that
                  -that will take us back to my Tokyo days, so far faded now. But still, those 3 years at TIS when we
                  would ski at Club Med twice -six days in December and four days over the mid-winter break -and a
                  school trip to Naeba/Shiga Kogen, plus maybe a weekend trip to Naspa with the family, I never hit
                  thirty days. A whole month dedicated to skiing, 1/12 of the year. And I am currently looking at
                  another day a Tuckerman's, spending Feb. 25th at an informal Beanpot race. That will take me to 32
                  days, and if I have time to take weekend trips and ski -which to be honest I have my doubts
                  -I may hit even more days.
                <br><br>
                  And at this point, skiing is more of a lifestyle than a vacation. You develop a routine, just like
                  the way I did swimming. I know what DINs mean, and I know what DINs I ski (I should be 8, but I
                  like to ski 10). I know how to strap the two power straps of the boots together after a day on the
                  mountain, making it easier to carry over my shoulder. I know that I have six items in my helmet -my neckwarmer, and
                  gloveliners that I keep in my pocket, my gloves, and my headcover -that stay in there. And I know
                  -I knew -the A-frame and its displeasing acidic carbonated water, yet acceptable because of the
                  memories. Just the whole experience of living with a ski team -the whole lifestyle of eating oatmeal
                  for breakfast, Ben yelling "time to get up!", driving to Ragged and setting courses, the George Foreman
                  grilled sandwiches, after-skiing runs down the wintry street in the nightlight, cooking dinner, watching ski movies, tuning skis, and
                  finally sleeping in the sleepy town of Rumney NH -is an experience that I simply am not able to
                  find in a conventional domesticated life.
                <br><br>
                  But unlike swimming this time I cannot and have not given as much heart as I did. Because swimming was
                  my life's work, starting from I was so so young, while race skiing feels like an imported act, something
                  picked up due to my rational mind but not my heart. Just like the way I don't feel as emotionally attached
                  to my college schoolwork as I did to my AP Euro or APUSH, because I am living in the present reality,
                  I must take the present moment and maximize my happiness. And I could argue that the memories with the
                  ski team are in a sense mediocre, but the past is perfect and the present is tense. Although I may not
                  have hit as deep conversations that I wanted to, which to some degree is a fault of my own, and to other
                  degrees is a reflection of American culture, I still had fun. And we still had great memories, skiing being
                  a sport that bonds us. In reality, I don't know how good I'll be at keeping in touch with people
                  after I graduate, and I don't know how truly connected I feel -just look at MAC swimming, I've lost some
                  friends already -but it was (is) worth the ride.
                <br><br>
                  Another reason why I can't put heart into skiing is because <i>I am not good at it</i>. Sure, you measure how good
                  you are relative to the field, and to the commoner I am far above average, but compared to MacConnell division,
                  I am pretty bad. My best race this season was the first run of slalom at Whiteface NY, where I finished ahead
                  of eight people (I had to hike for the second slalom course, so that race didn't turn out too well). I take
                  things too seriously that I can't commit to things if I am not going to get what I commit.
                <br><br>
                  And regret, regret is something that I do have to deal with, but in many ways unnecessary. In some sense the
                  standards that I bestow onto myself are unrealistic, expecting myself to compete with the college student-athletes
                  who have raced skiing all their lives. But just like the recreational swimming/competitive swimming dilemma,
                  I have been skiing for a while, just that I never went deep and specialized. Then again, in life you don't need
                  to be competitive in everything; you just need a few sharp skillpeaks -what are mine?
                <br><br>
                  And I do respect achievement, I do respect pure ability, just like how we all respect greatness. In our league,
                  in my frog of the well, we have the Brown Bears Women Skiing team, who really represent the so many good things
                  about life. They are the people who are both good at sports, and also at academics going to an Ivy League
                  institution. There's Natalie Pearl, a sophomore who basically won every race this season. There's Nika Mosenthal,
                  who sold Meaghan Fitzgerald her sister Kia's skis, Kia who is a Brown '12 that now coaches at Jackson Hole.
                  On the boy's club team, the girls cheer so emphatically everytime they race. I beat the other two Brown guys
                  a few times, although they also beat me a few times. But the Brown girls are so good, they
                  won every race this season -and a few seasons past -while holding classiness and kindness. Not only are
                  they the fastest on the mountain, but also the only team I noticed constantly raking the course,
                  there to help others race faster. And their whole team is so nice,
                  carrying coats down for us when we fuck up, cheering for us with the intensity that makes me
                  bubble inside, that when I heard we would potentially be training with them, I was nervous with excitement
                  the way I felt when waiting for facebook messages from THE <i>her</i>. Though the combined training never
                  materialized, and I never formally introduced myself to any of them, there is still a future of potential,
                  as I try to get myself more acquainted with the skiing world, something that I should've known more about,
                  should've dove deeper.
                <br><br>
                  And the memories of our New Hampshire Ford E Series, and the music that Mikey played as we navigated through
                  the windy roads of snowy Vermont, they all were great, were fun, though seemingly mediocre in the moment,
                  but still special and dear to me. Though I cannot say I am a good skier -more importantly, though I may not be
                  judging myself to the right standards, and to the American culture of pompousness and bullshit I am far humble
                  -our traveling experiences and driving through miles and miles mimicked a lifestyle of racing, training,
                  something outside of the MIT semester, but something that can't be found outside of MIT College either. Will
                  I be back next year? Initially I didn't plan to, but this was a wonderful experience, and I definitely want
                  to meet more skiers and really join the community. Would I do an externship over ski team? Probably not, because I have my whole life
                  ahead of me to work on working. Would I want to be on campus for another IAP? Probably not, because I experienced
                  that freshman year, and though it itself is not a bad experience, it's just more time at MIT, grinding. But with
                  diminishing returns, will next year's ski team be as valuable as this one, for the first time? And what about
                  going to China, where the semester at Beida may end in mid-January? All these questions are things that
                  I need to think about, but not with urgency.
                <br><br>
                  And now I can say that though I only raced once race as a varsity athlete in high school, I now have two sports
                  in college under my belt. But does it really count?? It was always my plan from high school to do a varsity sport
                  in college, because I felt a void that needed to be filled with my quitting of cross country, and Rivers not
                  having a swim team. I attained performance closure in The Sleepless Night, as I can live with my swimming
                  career having attained age groups, but it does tingle me to see Michael Lu and the MIT swim team and wonder
                  how much more time I could have shredded off. And I thought swimming in college was the varsity path, but
                  in my desperation I chose sailing and skiing. Because I have a longer history with skiing, I can say I enjoyed
                  the ski team more than sailing, partially because I am better at skiing, partially because I have simply spent
                  more time with the skiing fraternity. What do I plan to do about sports and extracurriculars at MIT, now that
                  I have expanded, and not sure what I want to do? I guess between 5 classes, sports, amphibious achievement, urop,
                  party, sleeping, and boredom for creativity, I can only choose a certain amount.

                <p>
                  And what, really, is life? As I accumulate more memories, I feel like I am not losing my youth and innocence to time, but to
                  experiences. When I carry so much weight on my shoulders, that I need to make decisions not only for the present
                  but the past and future, I need to consider choices on a more rational basis and not as much on pure impulse. I
                  can still be unconventional, I walked across the Charles river on the river today, and it was an interesting
                  experience, being the only dot of red and grey in the middle of the white fog. Traversing the Charles with no
                  one hundreds of feet from you, the city of Boston as your audience, alone together in this interesting little
                  snowcapped city, is something that I could only do alone because I couldn't find the friends to do it with me
                  at pilam. What is being connected when in a 4000 undergrad college I still do things alone? And as I check off
                  experiences, I trade insight for innocence, the knowledge of having crossed a river crossing out the pure simple desire.
                <br><br>
                  So what do I want to dedicate my life to? Looking through facebook profiles and getting a glimpse into the lives
                  of others, especially the Brown girls, I really don't know where I want to head. MIT tells me that I should
                  develop a very strong foundation in the maths and sciences, that my future lies in the path of becoming an
                  engineer and using my problem set knowledge to solve similar hard problems. But what about living? Look at
                  one girl's profile picture, "what are men to rocks and mountains" and the casual
                  Colorado mindset of taking multi-day backpacking trips with friends, what do I know about the real world
                  and enjoying life as a first-world citizen? If I for sure do not want to live the domesticated Asian life,
                  what kind of lifestyle do I want to pursue? Is my innocence leaving me, or do I have more time to explore?
                  And to go in deep, how do I do that?
                </p>
