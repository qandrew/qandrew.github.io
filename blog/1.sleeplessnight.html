                  And into the sleepless night I head.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In essence it was really only that short two minutes of swimming breaststroke, that felt like
                  forever while swimming it. I'm grinding so hard. Before swimming I'm doubting myself, I think
                  a six second drop is quite a bit. But I had already made four seconds in the first swim -so do
                  I go for time trials, take up my dad's time and my coaches' time and Franklin/Edlyn's time going
                  for it? Do I want to risk failure, fear of going a worse time than I did in the regular event swim?
                  But then I think, I've already gone all in, I've used my techsuit, my godlike Mizuno, I'm at Salem
                  State which is a special pool to me, I at least need to have the peace of mind that I tried my best,
                  that I truly gave my 100%, that even if I did not get there this year, even though it really was my
                  last opportunity to go for short course age groups, that I would need to be able to think it through
                  eventually in the future knowing that I did give it my best.
                </p>
                <p>
                  But after Jon helped me so much to get that time trials opportunity -knowing that it was past the 5pm
                  deadline to enter in swimmers -I knew I could not fail. Go for her later she is on my mind 100% of the
                  time she is my running blood but now is the time to shine.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I want it. Fuck it, I'm getting it. I've come so far, this is really my last chance, I have to get it. And
                  I know I can -just increase my tempo, stronger off walls while maintaining form.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I have never ever swam slower in the finals swim compared to the trials swim. My solo was the "trials", this
                  time trials is my finals, my final opportunity. I am not losing that streak. I will improve.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I cannot doubt myself. I need to go in with purity of mind, I know I can. I doubt a bit but I need to put all
                  that away. Just focus on the swim and what I need to do in the swim.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I need a timer. Thank god Charlie is there to help me, to carry me, he tells me I can do it. I take in all the
                  positive energy from our team and from other teams too, I ignore all negativity because I truly need to be focused here.
                </p>
                <p>
                  And I dive in and I execute my plan.
                </p>
                <p>
                  But in essence it was really those two minutes and twenty three seconds where I actually made the magic. And after it,
                  I know I made it, I look up trying to find my lane and I see the magical 2.23.62. FUCK YES. Indescribable joy.
                  Words cannot capture how excited I was -my heartbeat, my true pure thought. I congratulate Richard when he's done.
                  I'm so elated, I'm not medicated, even though I am my worst enemy.
                </p>
                <p><center> * * * </center></p>
                <p>
                  And its that two minutes and twenty three seconds and sixty two milliseconds that is most rewarding two minutes in
                  my life. A lot of my shortcomings in the past -never getting to swim at Tatsumi, Cross Country never breaking 20,
                  doubting myself never to be good at sports (parents always emphasize swimming just for not getting fat), potentially
                  also never making age groups for swimming, and other places where I fell -the sleepless night justifies.
                </p>
                <p>
                  And I try to extend that moment of such pure joy into the night, I don't want to let it go, but the true magic of it
                  is stuck in time, in my memory, in my rememory. At 12.51am, I can only look back and write it down. But it's not just
                  that swim that's valuable, it's also the countless practices, countless strokes I put into swimming, even the countless
                  arguments I had with Alex, and the whole package of rediscovering myself as a person exiting childhood innocence entering
                  America and all its big concepts. Through swimming I have learned about not swimming, but through swimming I never
                  actually got to my tangible swimming goals, until now.
                </p>
                <p>
                  And now I know that I can step up. Even if I had to wait this long, to the absolute last opportunity for me to get a
                  short course age group cut, I did. I carry that with me into the future.
                </p>
                <p>
                  And we're taught as kids to aim high, to go for As instead of being content with Bs, to go for the top colleges instead
                  of just being content with somewhere in the middle, to be ambitious, even though most people in this world do not end up
                  being the top 5%. But only if you go for it you can get it.
                </p>
                <p><center> * * * </center></p>
                <p>
                  After I swim I completely break down emotionally. In all honesty I didn't even feel this joyous after I got into MIT,
                  because this was definitely the harder task in my mind. I cry it all away. In a way I can say fuck you to my past failures,
                  the real me, the me that I want to be, is back. I hug Alex, I thank Jon, I hug Chantel, I'm so appreciative of all the
                  work and time and blood they've put into developing me these past years. My parents for supporting me, my friends for
                  carrying me when I fall. In a way it culminates in me making the cut, I'm not cut, I cut you.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Afterwards Coach Alex talks to me and tells me something along the line of this: "You really did a good job today. You
                  really deserved it. And there will always be doubters in this world telling you you cannot make it, you will fail, you
                  can't achieve it. There will always be people like that. But as long as you believe in yourself and know that you can
                  do it, you will make it. You can achieve anything in the world it does not matter what other people say, you just need
                  to believe in yourself." I'm soooooooo heartfelt.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "But now it's time to prepare for age groups. And we'll work towards MIT swimming."
                </p>
                <p>The process continues.</p>
                <p>The sleepless night justifies.</p>
