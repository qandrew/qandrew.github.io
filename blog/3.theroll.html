                  That cultural change may be the harder one yet the one requiring less technical knowledge, I understand.
                  That in our fiery essence, in the heart of the soul, in the nonconvention in symphony with the convention,
                  that we continue to beat up and on and iterate into time and into time more, I know. That I'mma keep on smoking
                  'til I can't hit another note, I commit. That I am me and I am not me, I stand true. That I have 802 to study for, I request.
                </p>
                <p>
                  But with all of this mixing pot, I iterate and iterate. I am a roll and I continue to roll. 2014 come and get me.
                  It is getting me, and I'm glad that the spring break is coming up. I have no clue what to expect out of spring break,
                  and I have no clue of what to expect out of my life. But there are things that keep beating me -beating me onwards.
                  Bluegreyblue eyes, this evernote, music, the unfinished Atlas Shrugged, Hongyi's mediocrity and in myself included,
                  and the undying Korean Bitch. What have I lost, and what keeps me pure, what keeps me inundated, what keeps me me, if I am still me.
                </p>
                <p>
                  While we live in four dimensions -time trapping us and carrying into the future, into the future, into the future we go -we are
                  in fact three-dimensional objects. While we do iterate onwards in time, the present is a three-dimensional entity, that I
                  am me in March 2014, that the March 2014 me is different from the 2013 me, the 2010 me, that we ebb and flow. In discrete
                  movement or in continuum I do not know, I have no knowledge of, but I am me and this text can complete an incomplete capture.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Is language inherently a limitation or an expander, as all of our vocabulary is a subset of the language meta, that if we can not
                  express what is out, then is our culture the fundamental limitation?
                </p>
                <p>
                  What does it mean to be a human? What part of me is me? Is it just my physical body? Does it include my past, my present, and my
                  future? What about my qualities, my internal and external attributes? Does everyone have an internal, or are we just amalgamations
                  of influences on society? Is the external comprised of the physical or the meta-physical -the clothing we wear, the food we eat,
                  the community we are in, or more: our inter-network, our connections and lines and dots -or will we ever know?
                </p>
                <p>
                  Kai is impressive.
                </p>
                <p>
                  What is music, especially when I zone out and I can't complete the work that I do. Is it just a series of frequencies and waves,
                  that work in conjunction when you are in the mood? And when you zone out it's just the noise? Selena and the Noise? Marina and the
                  Noise? <sup><a href="#fn2">2</a></sup> Andrew Xia in the noise?
                </p>
                <p>
                  What is my name and what does it mean? Where did the sound and the symbolism come from, the Andrew that I am referred to?
                </p>
                <p>
                  What is my culture? Am I out of the meta, can I truly step out? Should I have a Chinese name like Hongyi (what does that even mean)
                  or be like Jack Ma and use nicknames, for further protection? Why don't the Japanese, the Korean, the
                  Indian conform as much?
                </p>
                <p>
                  What do I want to do and what will my GPA come out as?
                </p>
                <p>
                  Is the world losing blue eyes, and in the case that I can't, I can't, then what am I?
                </p>
                <p>
                  And how do I expend the gender meta, if that is something that I care about?
                </p>
                <p>
                  What is a person, do I like people, who do I like, why do I like her if I do, what is her1 or her2 or her3 or
                  her4 or relics of a past that I can't stop won't stop going back to?
                </p>
                <p>
                  What is a hashtag?
                </p>
                <p>
                  What is conformity?
                </p>
                <p>
                  What is this language, a series of characters, that I ride on?
                </p>
                <p>
                  And in the establishment of time as a driver, as a screwdriver, as a screw, where do I iterate onwards to? I do sometimes look
                  forward, that the expansion of Andrew into newer areas -at the cost of contractions that I long, long forgot -at its surface always
                  seems beautiful, pristine, meaningful, but it's a tradeoff. Pilam for East Campus. 777 for 747. Wife for parents. Sex for innocence.
                  The future for the past, but never, never, the other way around. Never. Never. Nie. So moreso it is a tradeoff that I have no leverage on.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Do I still have the attention span to read a book? Is my restless heart going to rest? At least right now I can write.
                </p>
                <p>
                  But do, please do get me with those green eyes baby as the lights come down. April 4th, 2014, inside mediocrity,
                  I present myself the opportunity of the symbolism of her. Tomorrow I target.
                </p>
                <p>
                  What is wrong with my mind?
                </p>
                <p>
                  Iterating currently in the meta, in the depths beyond depths, in areas that I am still fundamentally confused about. Do not go here,
                  they say, do not ask those questions. Is my approach too narrow, am I too different from the world? JA783A stares at me (actually
                  right now it's the red hair and the eyest eyes of Marina and the Diamonds). Iterate me. Iterate me more. Ho ho, the me-est me and
                  the Andrewest Andrew and the iteration of language, god out of the well bring me more, bring me more.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Suicide is out of the question, it's a cheap escape, but it's that wild card. Quentin in <i>The Sound and the Fury</i> takes the easy path.
                  I would like to iterate more. Of course right now I see a sea of purposelessness, a plethora of selfish second-handers at MIT, that it
                  is the I first mindset. But I am the eye, the best me in the world, the one that is a bit too different. Unfortunately. Do I stay pure?
                  Is this canvas of mine trapped in the metas of this journal, this writing that does not comprehend and does not compress?
                </p>
                <h1>
                  <center>?</center>
                </h1>
                <p>
                  Do you now? I stare at you, and ? question mark you. Take me out of the meta, out of Biot-Savarts, and Germans and Frenches. Trenches.
                  Let my mind sore out into never never land. While I repeat the song. Black people music. Dub step music. Chinese music that I still
                  don't listen to enough. Tracy's unfinished playlist. My life, my MIT bubble. Not in a fuck you mood but in a what is life mood. Seventy
                  five minutes until 802 test. I should know the material, I should understand what I need to do on the test. Is writing a realer form of
                  production, if my goal in life is to produce?
                </p>
                <p>
                  Is it to produce? Ayn Rand says so. MIT culture says so, and we do UROPS (maybe I am too different, and those people genuinely want to do
                  U fucking ROPs). Giri says so -I mean, look across the Charles river under the tempestuous clouds, look at the John Hancock and the
                  buildings, look at what mankind has created. Look at MIT's doors and the classes we can take and the startups we can found and the journeys
                  we can head into. Do I want to? Do I have a choice?
                </p>
                <p>
                  I should create words. I should create worlds.
                </p>
                <p>
                  But back to the basics. What is deep is what you don't have. If it was easy then everyone would have it. You can't have everything. You
                  work with what you have.
                </p>
                <p>
                  And you work without what you've lost. Swimming. Tokyo. Hong Kong. Skiing. The innocence in some friends, that still, I don't know, they may be a
                  player of the marginal specs and differences. My friend's enthusiasm with another, my heart and my jealousy can't contain. But I am
                  iterating. And the 6006 pset leverage that I currently hold, on whether I should send them my answers, I don't know
                  what my approach should be. My logic is that I'll work on it with you, but I shouldn't just give you my free answers.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Ugh fuck I don't know.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I don't know.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I don't know.
                </p>
                <p>
                  What do I know? Take me back to the basics, the legitimacy, the outgrind, the Kendranice, the uninhibition, and the wisdom. Am I true to those
                  qualities? Am I? And what do I like? I guess I do like writing and I guess I do like the bluest of them all eyes. The eyest eye. My hair, close
                  to eight months. When do I plan that release. Who is the right person? Her? But that Chipotle lunch conversation iterated into the wrong direction.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Look at the Asian meta, that community there. Is that what I want to create and is that what I can
                  create? Or am I just an individual entity? I don't think I've ever been in a friend group and if it is about a game of commonalities,
                  in which I definitely do not and can not conform.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Oh, why is my mind so different? Will I be able to find a person that will be able to read this, as I begin to iterate deeper
                  and deeper and deeper? What is a true fit, and how do I force deep conversation? If I can drive conversations -not necessarily in the
                  most conventional manner, as Aneesh Anand definitely pointed out Tuesday night -then where do I want to drive them to?
                </p>
                <p>
                  To Spring break, to St Louis.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Do I have the confidence to share this? But anyhow the game is all about pushing myself out of my comfort zone, my confidence zone.
                  Given that people are interested in my writing...
                </p>
                <p>
                  Krishna<sup><a href="#fn3">3</a></sup> is half German. But if I make these random references then how can people follow? Will I even be able
                  to follow in the future? But I guess that's the way time works, that things are trapped in the past. But in the mind and the soul.
                  In the quirks and chaoses and chaoxs.<sup><a href="#fn4">4</a></sup>
                  Oh boy how time kills things.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The 2048 game is pretty good.<sup><a href="#fn5">5</a></sup> At least it's better then flappy bird. But then there's 2048 doge and
                  flappy bird. Welcome to 2048, bitch. But I guess I like it and I don't think I have the choice. You see, our whole society is constructed on
                  the model of time, from a physics perspective and a cultural perspective, in which time travel backwards could fundamentally
                  destroy our establishments.
                </p>
                <p>
                  But back to Krishna. He tells us do not delay gratification, go for it in the present. Med school is meant to turn you into a doctor.
                  Law school is to turn you into a lawyer. But grad school, grad school should be for the present, for your pure enjoyment of the labwork
                  that you'll do in the next few years. Do I have that level of purity in a specific field? But as he says, into time as you
                  head will you settle down.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Do I like the way I am right now? Into spring break I head, half of my spring term is over, yet it still feels like it just began. I have
                   an 802 test to compete in. I would like an A in that class. Hopefully in 5111, 21f402, and 15411 too. But it's not the end of the world.
                   It's not the end of the world.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                   Because this world is mine, and when I decide to commit and when I decide to be able to commit hopefully I'll create something.
                   I'm not like the Harvard where I have a vision but no skill. I'm not like the MIT where I'm a machine where my skill skyrockets,
                   but I have no individual mind. I am me, Andrew fucking Xia, on March 20th, 2014.
