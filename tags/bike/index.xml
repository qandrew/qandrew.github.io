      <description>Recently, due to COVID related lockdowns, a lot of my friends have been getting into cycling! I thought I&#39;d write a series of blog posts on how to get into cycling and what to look for.
Why do I enjoy cycling? For me, I started cycling in Fall 2017, after I had completed my undergraduate, and I was looking to pick up a new hobby. My friend Brian Axelrod introduced me to road biking, which I really enjoyed, especially climbing up the South Bay hills during my internship at Facebook.</description>
