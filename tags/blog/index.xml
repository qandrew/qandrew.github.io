      <title>Books that have Influenced me the Most</title>

      <description>2020 has been a year of quarantine and shelter in place. One hobby that I&#39;ve picked up significantly is that of reading. This year is by far the most I&#39;ve read since high school, when books were mandatory reading assignments for our English class. With more time and less places to go physically, books have offered my mind to explore many thoughts.
Much of my thinking and worldviews have been shaped by some books I&#39;ve much enjoyed.</description>

      <description>This year has been an interesting year to say the least. I recently hit my 1 year mark at Lime; by now I&#39;ve almost worked remotely longer than I have worked in the office. My San Francisco roommates Brian, Grace, Jason and I have a good routine at our apartment. We enjoy each others&amp;rsquo; companies as we cook, chat, and play games together. We&#39;ve lost much &amp;ndash;the ability to connect with our friends in person, the ability to mingle with our co-workers at the office, the ability to do so much of what normal life entailed &amp;ndash;but as much as my life has been affected, I would still consider myself very lucky.</description>

      <title>Getting Started With Cycling</title>

      <description>Recently, due to COVID related lockdowns, a lot of my friends have been getting into cycling! I thought I&#39;d write a series of blog posts on how to get into cycling and what to look for.
Why do I enjoy cycling? For me, I started cycling in Fall 2017, after I had completed my undergraduate, and I was looking to pick up a new hobby. My friend Brian Axelrod introduced me to road biking, which I really enjoyed, especially climbing up the South Bay hills during my internship at Facebook.</description>

      <description>I had been wanting to see a solar eclipse since when I first learned about them in first grade, and I distinctly remember in second grade while I was doing 体操 at 图强二小, I would look up directly at the sun, hoping to see an eclipse, and my mind would play games with me simulating how an eclipse may look. As a relatively rare natural phenomenon, occurring once every 18 months in a very lucky region of the world, it had always been my dream to witness one.</description>

      <title>How to travel the Last Mile: Urban Mobility Options</title>

      <description>Hi! As a passionate transit-oriented teen, I wanted to write this blog post to detail how multi-modal transportation options can be used to best fit one&#39;s transportation needs. For context, I am currently a student based in Santiago de Chile (May 2019).
Here are my realistic transportation options:
 I could either walk or run, as my human-powered mobility options. I could bike (or ride an electric scooter, skateboard etc), if I owned these micromobility options.</description>

      <description>Hi all! I thought I&#39;d update y&#39;all with some of my recent readings/watchings on the internet. (The picture above was taken in April 2019 during a hike to Cerro de la Cruz)
Thoughts on Life  How to Pick a Career (That Actually Fits You) | Wait But Why Wait but why has a nice illustration here of post-undergraduate meaning, in which our life paths are no-longer linear. I did not read the whole article but bits of it were inspiring.</description>

      <title>Cerro El Plomo</title>

      <description>I did not summit Cerro El Plomo this past weekend.
Closing the trip on Sunday night, in Rodrigo&#39;s car we descended back down to Santiago from our trailhead, the ski resort of Valle Nevado, at 3000m. The drive back down was a spectacular solace &amp;ndash;up in the mountains, over two kilometers above Chile&#39;s primary metropolis, you could see glimpses of the sea of lights peeking between mountain canyons, contrasting the clean clear air and the celestial sky in the highlands with urban civilization, cosmopolitanism, and reality down below.</description>

      <description>Hi all! I thought I&#39;d update y&#39;all with some of my recent readings/watchings on the internet. Above is a picture from our hike in El Cani, Chile, Jan 2019.
Business Articles  Behind the Big Promises of the Micromobility Industry | CityLab What is the future of transportation? While there is industry hype on self-driving cars, I personally believe that micromobility (dockless bikes and scooters) are the nearer term solution.

      <description>I should probably be writing my thesis for my MEng, but I&#39;ll start off kindling the writing part of my mind by procrastinating for a bit.
In the past year after I completed my undergraduate degree, I&#39;ve been slowing spending more time finding more about who I am. During the MIT undergraduate semesters, which was one of the best times of my life, I had a lot on my plate, from rushing problem set deadline to photography event to party &amp;ndash;it was the work-hard, play-hard lifestyle.</description>

      <description>Context During the summer of 2016, I made a series of vlogs documenting my travels through Asia. My friend Jingyi Zhao and I took a one week trip to Thailand before heading to Tokyo for a week to participate in the MUSCAT program organized by the university of Tokyo. Here are four videos that I made documenting the trip.
1. Flight to Thailand   2. Bangkok   3. Chiang Mai   4.</description>

      <title>MIT Sophomore Mixer Series</title>

      <description>Over IAP 2015 (MIT Speak for our January break), Justine Jang and I worked with Fred Daso and the MIT 2017 Class Council on the Mixer Series project as a way to connect MIT sophomores with each other.
 What we did MIT is a very diverse community, but students are very busy. So how does one meet new people outside of her daily life cycle of classes, clubs, psetting, and her friend group?</description>
