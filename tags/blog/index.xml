&lt;p&gt;Hello, this is my first blog post in a while :) I&amp;rsquo;ll keep to a minimalist writing style so reading this blog can be as fast and as helpful as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;credit-cards&#34;&gt;Credit Cards&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/nerdscholar/credit-card/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;credit card&lt;/a&gt; is a payment system. When you use a credit card to buy an item, you are effectively borrowing money from the bank, and you can pay the bank back within a subsequent 25-30 day period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A credit card is offered by a bank (Bank of America, Chase). Visa and MasterCard are payment networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;why-should-i-get-one&#34;&gt;Why should I get one?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build your &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/category/finance/credit-score/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;credit score&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fraud protection&lt;/strong&gt;: if you purchased a fradulent item, and you want to cancel the purchase, with a credit card, you can call the bank and get your money back (the bank assumes the risk). However, if you purchase such item with a debit card or cash, your money has been spent and cannot be retrieved.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rewards&lt;/strong&gt;: many credit cards may offer 2% cash back, which means you are saving money every time you buy an item.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Foreign Transaction Fees&lt;/strong&gt;: if you travel frequently, there are credit cards with no foreign transaction fees, which might be a better exchange rate than going to a counter. (Though, different credit card networks may offer different conversion rates).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;why-shouldn-t-i-get-one&#34;&gt;Why shouldn&amp;rsquo;t I get one?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tendencies to &lt;strong&gt;overspend&lt;/strong&gt; with credit cards lead to debt accumulation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interest rates&lt;/strong&gt; for paying the debt are very high. If you pay on time, though, there is no debt.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;things-to-look-for-when-choosing-a-credit-card&#34;&gt;Things to look for when choosing a credit card&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is there an &lt;em&gt;annual fee&lt;/em&gt;? Usually the credit cards with better rewards also have an annual fee ($95/year), so if your spending&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Foreign transaction fees&lt;/em&gt;? When using a credit card abroad, you may be charged up to 3% extra for the purchase. However, this fee is waived for many cards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Signup bonus&lt;/em&gt;? Some credit cards may offer 30,000 miles (or cashback) for the first $1000 you spend in the first 3 months of opening a card, which may be a tremendous value!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rewards&lt;/em&gt;? This is the key part of credit cards -taking advantage of the rewards! Whether you prefer cashback, airline miles, AMC movie discounts, etc, you should choose a card that best fits your needs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;which-credit-cards-should-i-get&#34;&gt;Which credit cards should I get?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I am a student, the credit cards that I&amp;rsquo;m mentioning are targeted towards my spending category.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;general-usage&#34;&gt;General Usage&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These credit cards have rewards that are&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://c1.nerdwallet.com/images/4220_729390816ccdb615ef999cd87032af4f_L.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Credit Card&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By far, I&amp;rsquo;d highly recommend the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.citi.com/credit-cards/credit-card-details/citi.action?ID=citi-double-cash-credit-card&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Citi Double Cash Card&lt;/a&gt;. You get 2% cash back on every single purchase with no restrictions. No annual fees, but there is a foreign transaction fee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(However I think the fineprint states that to get the 2nd percent cash back, you must wait for the transaction to be confirmed before you pay back. Essentially, wait a while before you actually make your credit card payment for this card.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://c1.nerdwallet.com/images/3214_dba0115abf776ec818e0e8c96368e362_L.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Chase&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m currently using the &lt;a href=&#34;https://creditcards.chase.com/a1/freedom-unlimited?CELL=6B4W&amp;amp;jp_cmp=cc/Freedom%20Unlimited_Brand_Exact_Freedom%20Unlimited_SEM_US_No%20xLOB_Standard_NA_MMTest/sea/NmfddVbu/Chase%20Freedom%20Unlimited&amp;amp;kwdID=NmfddVbu_dc&amp;amp;adgrpID=207361584940&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Chase Freedom Unlimited&lt;/a&gt;, which offers 1.5% cash back, and no annual fees. This credit card also offers $175 back for the first $500 you spend in the past 3 months, so it&amp;rsquo;s better than the Citibank card for up to the first $35,000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://res.cloudinary.com/value-penguin/image/upload/fl_png8,f_auto,q_90/v1438118632/credit_cards/ztwxtj1e26gh6d2y8rqu.png&#34; alt=&#34;BoA&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also have the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.valuepenguin.com/bankamericard-better-balance-rewards-card&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;BankAmericard® Better Balance Rewards™ Credit Card&lt;/a&gt;. You essentially get $100 caskback every year as long as you pay in full, so it&amp;rsquo;s a nice credit card to have to get the flat rewards. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if it&amp;rsquo;s offered anymore, though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;airline-rewards&#34;&gt;Airline Rewards&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are the cards that generally I&amp;rsquo;d apply to, and then CANCEL them once I get the initial rewards so you don&amp;rsquo;t get charged the annual fee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://c1.nerdwallet.com/images/1010_cc47a1a5ee39357fc30b0956ac636838_L.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Delta&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I currently have the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.americanexpress.com/us/credit-cards/card/delta-skymiles/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Delta Gold SkyMiles&lt;/a&gt; card. Currently, you earn 30k miles (roughly $400) for the first $1k you spend, which is a 40% discount rate! You also get 1 free check-in baggage when flying Delta, and priority boarding, and no foreign transaction fees. The annual fee of $95 is waived the first year, so be sure to cancel it in the first year :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that the initial miles bonus varies over time (I got 60k miles when I applied), so you may also want to wait for a better miles deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://c1.nerdwallet.com/images/4001_10e0b458979cb0521292536baee76173_L.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;AA&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also had the &lt;a href=&#34;https://secure.fly.aa.com/citi/direct-plat?anchorLocation=DirectURL&amp;amp;title=citi&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;American Airlines Citibank&lt;/a&gt; credit card. You also earn 30k miles for the first $1k you spend, plus similar perks with the Delta credit card. I got the initial bonus, and cancelled it because of the annual fee. However, holding onto the credit card is still nice because I can show the card to the gate attendants at the airport and occasionally get priority boarding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://c1.nerdwallet.com/images/3049_12169088ebdb44fed1214e8549a23e72_L.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;United&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And of course, there&amp;rsquo;s the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www2.theexplorercard.com/40kAF?CELL=B4W&amp;amp;jp_cmp=cc/United%20Explorer_Brand_Exact_United%20Explorer_SEM_US_No%20xLOB_Standard_NA_MMTest/sea/18GOqH4i/Chase%20United&amp;amp;kwdID=18GOqH4i_dc&amp;amp;adgrpID=211099896667&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;United Chase&lt;/a&gt; credit card. Currently you get 40k miles for the first $1k you spend, and similar perks and annual fee. I don&amp;rsquo;t have this yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you fly other airlines more frequently, feel free to look up their credit cards and their perks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;general-tips&#34;&gt;General Tips&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Setup autopay from your bank account, and always pay in full&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get a credit card as early as possible to build your credit score&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s okay to have multiple credit cards open, but make sure you keep track of the finances in such cards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading! This is meant to be an introduction to credit cards, so I didn&amp;rsquo;t go into many of the rewards details (technically the Chase credit card reimburses you in Chase UltimateReward points which then you can convert to cash, or miles).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll try to write on Investing (Robinhood, Bitcoin, Vanguard, RothIRA) next time.&lt;/p&gt;
