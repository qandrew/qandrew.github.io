Recent efforts from both the industry and academia have shown that verification can scale to complex real-world systems; one prominent example is Microsoft’s IronClad project. However, such verification still requires a lot of manual effort in writing specifications. This includes finding appropriate lemmas: auxiliary propositions that are necessary to hold true, so that they can be used to prove the given difficult property. By providing needed lemmas, we can essentially decompose a verification problem into multiple simpler subproblems. Such modularity is the key for verifying properties of complex software systems. Interestingly, the process of finding appropriate lemmas can in many cases be automated.<br><br>This project is about performing a case study of existing modern systems and verifying some interesting properties about the code. A student will have a chance to experiment with state-of-the-art verification techniques, including unbounded-domain techniques, such as those employed in Dafny and Leon verifiers (that use SMT solving), and bounded-verification solvers such as Sketch and Alloy. The end goal of the project is learning about some state-of-the-art techniques in verification in general, and lemma discovery in particular, and getting insights about difficulties in applying them for verification of complex software systems.

Large-scale health records are a vital resource in medical research, and provide an opportunity to better understand the associations between complex disease processes and patient outcomes.  The Laboratory for Computational Physiology at MIT is currently engaged in NIH-funded research in critical-care informatics and complex physiological signal analysis. We are developing a major research database of physiologic and clinical data from intensive care patients that will support the design and evaluation of advanced patient monitoring algorithms.  This project aims to apply advanced machine learning techniques to automatically identify patterns from large volumes of clinical and physiological data, including text, time series, and high-resolution signals, of an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) database for patient prognosis, disease correlation studies, and cohort stratifications.  Project may include opportunities for hands-on experience in large-scale distributed data analytics using cloud-based infrastructure, such as Amazon AWS.

In the analysis and modeling of biomedical signals (but also in many other settings), it is often the case that the signals one measures are the result of mixing together underlying signals that are ultimately of interest. Under particular assumptions, the framework of independent component analysis (ICA) allows reconstruction of the underlying signals. This project will study various extensions of the ICA paradigm --- analytically, in simulation experiments, and potentially with clinical data. In the same spirit, we will study the application to biomedical signals of a new notion of causal coherence that we have developed.

A critical problem for computer graphics and medical imaging is correspondence, the task of matching points on one surface to points on another.  Right now, there are two main approaches to this problem.  Initially, algorithms inspired by classical differential geometry were designed to compute a map that minimizes measures of stretch or distortion, at high computational cost.  More recently, “functional maps” and other techniques try to find maps in a multiscale way, matching large parts to large parts and adding extra detail with controllable computational cost; these algorithms are fast but need lots of user guidance because it’s hard to measure how much they distort a surface.  In this SuperUROP, you will bridge between these two worlds by developing multiscale notions of map distortion.  This project is great for students interested in combining mathematical theory (geometry and optimization) with numerical methods (semidefinite programming) and practical data.

Migraine is a very common neurological disease, affecting about 10% of the American population. It is also a very debilitating disease and has been termed the 'most disabling neurological disorder on the planet.' The exact triggers for a migraine attack vary from person to person and might vary from one attack to the next. To understand the triggers for a migraine attack, this project seeks to build a smart phone app for migraine sufferers to log their migraine attacks and to collect data from the environment and from the patient. This data will be used to develop mathematical models to predict a migraine attack before it occurs.

The Laboratory for Computational Physiology at MIT is focused on the study of complex biomedical and physiologic signals.  The aim of this project is to explore the use of advanced machine learning techniques, including neural networks, to address the problems of reducing false arrhythmia alarms (e.g., asystole, ventricular flutter/fibrillation) in intensive care units (ICU) patients and distinguish clinically important events from noise. ICU false alarm rates have been reported to be as high as 86%, and can lead to disruption of care and slow response time due to desensitization from clinical staff (&quot;alarm fatigue&quot;). Most alarms operate on single channels, and there is great opportunity to develop techniques incorporating information from simultaneously measured signals. During the course of this project the student will develop their skills in signal processing, applied biomedical signal processing, and machine learning in a real world scenario. The project has additional scope for methods which can maximize learning from both unlabeled and labeled data.

The past two decades have witnessed rapid advances towards building quantum information processors that promise to be exponentially more powerful than classical computers at certain tasks. Research groups, governments, and industry -- including Google, IBM, Microsoft, Raytheon, D-Wave etc --  are just a few examples of companies investing heavily into quantum computing. Among solid-state qubit systems, the nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond has emerged as an excellent optically addressable memory with second-scale electron spin coherence times. Recently, quantum entanglement and teleportation have been shown between two nitrogen-vacancy memories, but scaling to larger networks requires more efficient spin-photon interfaces and on-chip integration of quantum memories with high-performance optoelectronic control. One important problem is to find a way to provide optical pumping to hundreds of quantum registers, ideally with hundreds of individually tunable lasers. Developing such an architecture of chip-integrated lasers is the goal of this SuperUROP project. If successful, the project would have impact beyond quantum computing in fields such as sensing and high-speed optical interconnects in multiprocessor computing. <br><br>The project end goals are:<br><br>1.

Spintronic devices have many advantages such as non-volatility, better scalability and lower power consumption. However, compared with conventional electronic devices, the operating speed of spintronic devices is not particularly attractive at this moment. Currently, the time scale needed for reorienting the magnetic moment usually ranges between one and a few tens nanosecond. In order to replace currently existing devices and to be fully integrated with nowadays’ computational circuits, the operating speed of spintronic devices need to be greatly increased. In this project, the student will carry out experiments that focus on growing new ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic materials, fabricating nanoscale devices which utilize the fast dynamics of these new material, as well as building automatic data acquisition system which can probe the switching/oscillation dynamics in these structures.<br><br>Prerequisite: Previous experience with material growth, previous knowledge on microfabrication (6.152 or equivalent), or quantum mechanics will be a big plus, but not necessary.

Utilizing electrons’ spin allow us to make novel electronic devices. These spintronic devices show promising applications in many digital and analog areas, such as memory, logic, microwave generation and amplification. So far, the majority of spintronic devices are made out of bulk materials. The recent discovery of low dimensional materials opens up the possibility of studying the spin generation and transportation in a much smaller length scale. Particularly, the 2D materials, which are only one or a few atomic layers thick, can be very promising candidates for the next-generation spintronic devices as they exhibit unique spin related transport properties, such as ultra-long spin relaxation time, spin-valley locking, spin-momentum locking, etc. In this project, the students will fabricate nanoscale devices using 2D materials such as graphene, MoS2, etc and study the transport properties of electron spins in these materials. The understanding gained through the experiment can help us to make memory or logic devices which has very low power consumption and very high operating speed.

The Robot Locomotion group has been selected to receive NASA's humanoid robot, Valkyrie, in order to evaluate the advanced force/torque control capabilities of the robot.  Val uses series-elastic actuators, providing high-performance torque sensing and control, but also potentially introducing additional dynamics from the springs.  This project will study the consequences of these springs in the balancing control feedback loop, with the goal of demonstrating exquisite control on the real machine.

Are financial irregularities commonplace in high frequency trades? Modern exchanges have mechanisms in place to moderate fluctuations in stock market prices, but occasionally unexplained swings in stock prices can and do occur, often in the span of 100 milliseconds or shorter.

Modern processors feature many optimizations that improve performance on regular, predictable programs that consist of one or a few long-lived threads. Historically, most applications (e.g., operating systems, databases, etc) have been structured this way. But there has been a recent shift towards event-based programming, e.g., as in JavaScript, where programs consist of many short events. With the rise of just-in-time JavaScript compilers in both browsers and web servers, systems across all domains spend a lot of cycles running these applications, but their performance on these programs is mediocre. A large part of the problem is that these applications are poorly understood.<br><br>In this project, you will analyze browser and server-side (NodeJS) programs running on a state-of-the-art JavaScript engine (Chrome's V8). You will use cutting-edge processor performance analysis and simulation frameworks to find their key performance bottlenecks.

Data movement limits the performance and efficiency of multicore chips. For example, a single memory access costs as much energy as a thousand compute operations. Unfortunately, current architectures and parallel programs still use techniques and abstractions designed decades ago, when computation was expensive and data movement was cheap, so they often cause much more data movement than needed. To tackle this problem, we are designing data-centric multicores that seek to minimize data movement as a primary design objective. Because excessive data movement often stems from a disconnect between hardware and software, we are taking a holistic approach that leverages the strengths of hardware and software techniques, achieving gains that neither hardware-only nor software-only approaches can provide.<br><br>We've recently shown that a combination at hardware and OS-level software mechanisms can reconfigure the chip to place data close to the threads that use it much better than hardware alone can, reducing on-chip data movement by an order of magnitude transparently to applications. In this project, you will explore how to take these techniques one step further, by co-adapting parallel applications and the hardware they run on. You will work with a flexible parallel runtime that already executes many data-intensive applications efficiently (e.g., raytracing, MapReduce, crypto, etc.). You will then adapt existing techniques and design new approaches to reduce data movement by placing both the different types of data in the application, and the tasks that operate on that data. This will enable many challenging memory-intensive applications to scale to multicore chips with hundreds to thousands of cores, without burdening programmers with the complexities of explicit data movement.

hared clusters and datacenters are vastly underutilized: the average CPU utilization across all commercial datacenters is a measly 6%, and even the most advanced systems (e.g., Google's fleet) are used at 20-30% of their capacity. This low utilization wastes billions of dollars in infrastructure and terawatt-hours of energy yearly. The main reason for low utilization is the need for high, predictable performance. Current multicore systems cannot control how different applications share hardware resources, so running multiple applications degrades performance and introduces unpredictability. To avoid this problem, users overprovision their systems and run them far below their peak capacity.<br><br>We are designing an experimental cluster prototype that uses new hardware partitioning techniques to achieve near-peak utilization without hurting performance. In this system, a software runtime shifts hardware resources (e.g., cores, power, memory, and bandwidth) to guarantee performance targets for critical applications as efficiently as possible, and safely shares all spare capacity among non-critical tasks. In this project, you will first learn about this hardware testbed, analyzing how the system adapts to the needs of applications and shifts resources over time. Then, you will design a scheduling algorithm that uses this knowledge to better distribute applications across machines to maximize performance and utilization.

Current multicores suffer from two main limitations: they can only exploit a fraction of the parallelism available in applications, and they are very hard to program. We are designing a new type of multicore architecture that tackles both problems. In this architecture, called Swarm, programs consist of very short tasks, as small as tens of instructions each. Hardware queues and distributes tasks among cores, reducing the overheads of fine-grain parallelism and allowing many more applications to be parallelized. Moreover, parallelism is implicit: instead of using locks, semaphores, or other error-prone explicit synchronization techniques, programmers simply define an order among tasks. Under the covers, Swarm hardware figures out what order constraints are superfluous and elides them, running most tasks in parallel. As a result, Swarm programs are almost as simple as their sequential counterparts, and at the same time outperform the best parallel programs.<br><br>We have already demonstrated Swarm's benefits on challenging applications, like graph analytics and databases, including achieving a 200x speedup on an algorithm where no prior parallel implementations could beat the sequential one. But there is much more to do! Given the broad scope of this project, there are many areas where you can contribute, depending on your interests. For example, you can:<br><br>- Port challenging parallel applications to Swarm (e.g., circuit and network simulators, SAT solvers, or a program of your choice).<br><br>- Develop new profiling and visualization tools that help programmers understand performance and parallelism bottlenecks.<br><br>- Design new techniques to parallelize sequential programs almost automatically.<br><br>- Improve Swarm's design, e.g., by designing predictors that infer what tasks are likely to be independent to increase performance even further.

Electronic medical records are becoming a rich resource in health research, and provide an opportunity to understand the relationship between complex disease processes and patient outcomes.  The Laboratory for Computational Physiology at MIT is currently engaged in NIH-funded research in critical-care informatics. We have developed a major research database of physiologic and clinical data from intensive care patients that will support the design and evaluation of advanced patient monitoring algorithms, as well as clinical studies. (<a href="http://mimic.physionet.org/" target=new>Link</a> ) Evaluating and monitoring patients in the critical care setting can be challenging, as determining patient status and prognosis can be both complex and dynamic.  In particular, certain aspects of patient health are measured frequently, while others may be measured sparsely and irregularly, or only when sought by the healthcare provider.  Several approaches for modeling this type of repeatedly measured data exist, and this project aims to explore the best practices for a variety of different types of data and objectives.  The project includes opportunities to explore statistical and machine learning approaches for modeling time series and longitudinal data, and will use data from real patients.

Programming communities for experienced software engineers such as Stack Overflow and Github do not work well for beginners. For example, beginners have trouble translating their code into a precise technical question or query, and they have trouble translating a terse technical answer into working code. Consider this blog post by Tom Dalling ( <a href="http://www.programmingforbeginnersbook.com/blog/friction_between_programming_professionals_and_beginners/" target=new>Link</a> ) about the mismatch, and consider previous attempts to bring examples into programming UI such as this CHI paper by Brandt et al ( <a href="http://hci.stanford.edu/publications/2010/blueprint/brandt_chi10_blueprint.pdf" target=new>Link</a> ).<br><br>This project will knock down the barriers to social coding by creating a new social programming UI. Instead of separating the IDE from the community site, this beginner IDE should be the community site itself.

Terahertz wave is a safe (compared to X-ray) and high-resolution (compared to microwave) tool for non-invasive imaging in security and industrial quality control. We have developed focal-plane detector arrays for THz imaging. However, due to the large wavelength (~0.5mm) that determines the on-chip antenna size, it is impossible to integrate a large number of THz pixels on a single chip. Because of this, THz imagers often use mechanical scanner which is bulky and slow. In the next generation of THz image sensors, the pixels detect not only the intensity of the incident THz wave, but also its phase. It is then possible to achieve electronic scanning inside a 2D space; hence the mechanical scanner is eliminated. It is also possible to perform such full-wave analysis across a broad frequency range, so that the 3D information of the object’s inner structure is extracted. The SuperUROP in this project will have the opportunity to (1) build the test board for beam steering and data sampling, (2) develop signal processing algorithms that reconstruct the 2D/3D images from the raw data of our chips. (3) It is also possible to implement good design ideas in a real CMOS chip.

A wide range of gas molecules have rotational states that can be excited by terahertz waves. Based on this principle, spectroscopy using continuous-wave, phase-locked THz signal is able to provide very high sensitivity and specificity. Potential applications of this technology include airborne-agent identification, medical diagnosis (e.g. breath analysis for blood glucose level monitoring), and fundamental applied science. The Terahertz Integrated Electronics Group is currently developing fully-integrated THz spectrometers on CMOS chips. The research for the SuperUROP student in this project includes (but not limited to): (1) the design of high-resolution frequency synthesizer at the PC board and chip levels. (2) Gas spectroscopy experiments, and (3) data-processing algorithms that can resolve the absorption spectrum when significant overlaps between the “fingerprints” of different molecules exist due to spectral broadening. (4) Preliminary studies on how to use the stable resonance frequency of a molecule to calibrate the clock frequency generated on chip. This project is perfect for the students who wish to apply frontier electronic technologies into the study of chemistry, biology and applied physics.

The spatial organization of the genetic material in the cell nucleus is known to be important for gene regulation. During most of the cell cycle each chromosome occupies a roughly ellipsoidal domain in the cell nucleus. Hence, the spatial organization of chromosomes can be modeled as an ellipsoid packing problem: 46 ellipsoids of a given size and shape (the chromosomes) should be packed into an ellipsoidal container (the cell nucleus) so as to minimize their overlap under various constraints. The goal of this project is to use optimization theory to develop algorithms that find locally optimal minimal overlap configurations of ellipsoids under various constraints. Biologically relevant constraints include distance to the boundary of the container, overlap between specific ellipsoids, or changing container shapes. The obtained ellipsoid configurations will be compared to experimental data and used to predict the new chromosome neighborhoods when altering the shape of the nucleus.

Every cell in our body contains the same genetic information. However, we have many different cell types and they all show different gene expression patterns. In order to understand how this is possible, we will study how the different gene expression patterns develop, starting from a stem cell and differentiating into the different cell types. We will assume that gene expression develops along the tree according to a multivariate Brownian motion with correlation among the genes. Given gene expression data from various points along the unknown differentiation tree, the goal of this project is to develop algorithms that can simultaneously map the cells to the differentiation tree and learn the underlying tree topology. What statistical guarantees can be obtained? How well does the algorithm perform on simulations? Does it provide meaningful differentiation trees when applied to real biological data?

Causal inference is a cornerstone of scientific discovery because it asks “why?”. Most methods for learning causal directed graphs assume that the underlying graph is a DAG, i.e., that it does not contain any directed cycles. However, feedback loops in biological networks are not only common but also crucial features. In addition, many causal inference algorithms do not allow for imposing prior knowledge on the directed graph or cannot be applied to large networks. In this project, the goal is to develop causal inference algorithms that can overcome these limitations and can be applied to infer gene regulatory networks. These networks have about 20'000 nodes, but there is a lot of prior information on the network coming from knock-out experiments. In order to increase the power of the methodology, it is important to be able to use this prior information. What statistical guarantees can be obtained and what is the computational trade-off? How well does the algorithm perform on simulations? Does it provide meaningful gene regulatory networks when applied to real biological data?

Key to developing large-scale quantum communication and computation networks is the ability to transport flying qubits efficiently. However, current applications have been limited by high absorption losses of the near-infrared emission in optical fiber [8]. While red frequency down-conversion to the telecom band has been achieved, demonstrations at NV wavelengths have thus far been limited to 44% efficiency due to fluorescence noise from the above-band pump lasers used to perform the conversion [9]. We are developing a system for converting the 637 nm NV emission to the near-telecom band, where we can use below-band pumping to mitigate this background. Doing so will enable us to use a recently established fiber link between MIT Building 36 and MIT Lincoln Lab to entangle NV centers over a distance of 20 km. Once established, this link will be key in performing long-distance quantum communication, quantum key distribution, distributed computation, and developing quantum repeater technologies.<br><br>The student will be expected to focus on the following tasks: <br>Build and calibrate the frequency conversion system using periodically poled nonlinear crystals and 637 nm lasers<br>Learn how to coherently manipulate and readout an NV spin qubit <br>Use the system to coherently convert NV emissions into the near-telecom band for long-distance entanglement protocols<br><br>Prerequisites: Highly motivated students should have a course in quantum mechanics and be capable of programming in MATLAB or Python.<br><br>[1] Doherty, M.

III-V compound semiconductor transistor scaling is ongoing into the sub-10 nm scale. To this end, transistors in nanowire and fin configuration are required. Our group has developed a state-of-the-art finFET process which allows the fabrication sub-10 nm wide fins with high aspect ratio. However, to keep improving the performance we need to increase the fin density. One way to accomplish this is using an advance processing technique named “spacer lithography” shown in the figure. An important outcome of this approach is that edge roughness on both sides of the fins is correlated. This has important consequences for manufacturing control and device performance.

The Speech Communication Group is working on analyzing children’s speech, from both typically and atypically developing children, using the landmark/acoustic cue system developed in our lab. Landmarks are robustly-detectable locations in the signal ('acooustic edges') that indicate classes of speech sounds, i.e. vowels, glides, and consonants, which are defined and distinguished by their manner features. Additional acoustic cues near landmarks specify other distinctive features, related to place of articulation and voicing, that further define each sound. The specific realizations of landmarks and other acoustic cues are strongly impacted by prosodic events such as phrase boundaries and phrase-level accents. We have applied this feature-cue-based approach to child speech elicited by non-word repetition tasks, with hand labeling of the landmarks, and the next step will be to label the other landmark-related cues associated with the distinctive features for place and voicing.<br>The SuperUROP candidate will be involved in labeling of children’s speech with acoustic cues using Praat, and with analysis of those labels using statistical analysis packages. In addition, he/she will be involved in running and developing software for automatic detection of landmarks. <br>The figure illustrates Landmark annotation for a non-word repetition task. It shows a sample annotation using Praat (freeware for displaying and labelling sound files) with tiers showing words, phones, predicted acoustic landmarks, landmark modifications and glottal events. Vowel landmarks are marked V, and consonantal closures are marked with a –cl. Voicing onsets/offsets are marked +g/-g. Labeled data are then analyzed to indicate in what contexts landmarks are modified.<br>The candidate should be able to program in Python, Matlab, R, C/C++, Java, or similar.

Multimethods are an object-oriented programming model implemented by a handful of languages, such as R (in its S4 object model), Dylan, CLOS, and Julia. While offering extremely powerful polymorphism and code organization capabilities, multimethods are difficult to implement efficiently in practice.

The language must also have a mechanism for detecting and resolving ambiguous methods.<br><br>The goal of this project is to explore and implement new data structures for resolving dynamic multiple dispatch in Julia.

Unlike traditional, i.e., uniaxial, electrospray that has been known for hundreds of years, coaxial electrospray was first reported less than 15 years ago as a technique to generate core-shell particles with very low dimensional spread. Unfortunately, electrospray emitters have very low throughput; therefore, the utilization of electrosprayed core-shell particles in many practical applications, e.g., drug release, is commercially unfeasible. Arrays of Electrospray Emitters would be a viable approach to greatly increase the throughput; however, the structural complexity of coaxial emitters refrained their implementation using standard microfabrication. We recently demonstrated the first MEMS coaxial electrospray arrays using stereolithography -a 3D printing technology based on layer-by-layer creation of solids using photosensitive polymers. This UROP project looks to further explore our coaxial electrospray technology. A first possibility is to improve the 3D printed coaxial electrospray designs, for example, by creating MEMS that can generate core-shell-shell micro particles; a second possibility is to use the existing designs to generate core-shell particles for a specific application, e.g., tissue scaffold, , self-healing composites, energy, etc.

Electrospinning is the only known process that can generate nanofibers of arbitrary length with controlled morphology, and it has unmatched versatility as it can create non-woven/aligned mats of metallic, dielectric, and semiconducting fibers.  However, the practical application of these nanofibers is limited to high-end products because of the very low throughput of standard electrospinning sources. Increasing electrospinning throughput by multiplexing emission sources has been actively investigated for over a decade, including MEMS versions that consume less power and operate at lower voltage than macrosized sources. We recently demonstrated a novel MEMS-based modular architecture for nanofiber generation that circumvents the problems associated with miniaturization of these sources: clogging, large operational pressure, and lack of field enhancers to further reduce the operational voltage and localize the emission. We recently realized that the characteristic dimensions of optimized devices (roughness, height, aspect ratio) line up nicely with the resolution capabilities of high-end 3D printers. This project looks to demonstrate multiplexed electrospinning sources using additive manufacturing.

Project description: Quantum cryptography is the art of encrypting and transmitting information with absolute security that is guaranteed by quantum mechanics, rather than the difficulty of certain mathematical problems. We have developed nanophotonic chips that are able to perform quantum cryptography using quantum light. In this particular project, we are attempting to integrate the electronics and the photonics aspects of nanoscale quantum cryptographic systems to make them practical for everyday use.<br><br>Your roles: You will develop an FPGA signal generator capable of generating high-speed analog signals for driving quantum cryptographic systems. Eventually, you will deploy the systems and perform quantum cryptography experiments between MIT and MIT Lincoln Laboratory.<br><br>Qualifications: We are looking for a student who has a strong background in FPGA development as well as digital and analog signal processing. Knowledge of circuit design and/or quantum mechanics are a plus, but not necessary. More importantly, the student should be pro-active and excited about designing opto-electrical quantum systems.

Why is human vision so much better than machine vision? How do we describe what we see? How do you recognize an event that someone is describing? How do you learn language when all you hear are sentences with words you don't understand?<br><br>We are interested in understanding these questions by developing models that jointly address vision and language. These models should allow you to perform tasks that come naturally to children but are difficult for machines: describing what you see, seeing what is being described, asking questions about what you see, determining if what you are seeing is reasonable, using knowledge from language to change your mind about what you are seeing, etc.<br><br>This project aims to develop new models, extend current models to novel environments, or answer novel questions about language and vision.

We study the problem in which someone is tasked to travel among and gather intelligence at a set of spatially distributed point-of-interests (POI)s. The quality of the information collected at each POI is characterized by some sensory (reward) function of time. With limited time, the challenge is to balance between spending time traveling to more POIs and spending time visiting the POIs. In a dual formulation, the traveler may be required to acquire a minimum mount of reward with the least amount of time. We are developing an anytime planning algorithm and an implementation for solving these problems. In this project we wish to develop a web-based system along with an app that will enable users to get itineraries and balance their time across POIs in cities.

Designing and fabricating new robotic systems is typically limited to experts, requiring engineering background, expensive tools, and considerable time. In contrast, to facilitate everyday users in developing custom robots for personal use, this project aims to create algorithms, systems, and tools to easily create printable robots from high-level structural specifications.  From that, the system generates complete mechanical drawings suitable for fabrication, instructions for the assembly of electronics, and software to control and drive the final robot.This project aims to develop steps towards creating a hardware compiler.

Information extraction from mobile phones, smart glasses, or robots sensors such as GPS and video over long periods of time enable the autonomous analysis of the activity stream for the mobile agent that generated these capabilities. The collected data is valuable for mapping, situation awareness, and modeling behaviors, but requires efficient tools that can extract the right information at the right time efficiently. In this project we develop algorithm and system for autonomously extracting activities from GPS and video streams.
