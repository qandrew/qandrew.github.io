[{"authors":["Andrew Xia"],"categories":null,"content":"I didn\u0026rsquo;t summit Cerro El Plomo this weekend. Sunday night, I am in Rodrigo\u0026rsquo;s car descending back down to Santiago from our trailhead, the ski resort of Valle Nevado, at 3000m. The descent back into the city was spectacular. Up in the mountains, over two kilometers above Chile\u0026rsquo;s primary metropolis Santiago, you could see glimpses of the sea of lights peeking between mountain canyons, contrasting the clean clear air and the celestial sky in the highlands with urban civilization, cosmopolitanism, and reality down below. I was a kilometer away from being as close to heaven as I possibly could have been \u0026ndash;the summit standing at a proud 5424m \u0026ndash;when during my summit attempt on Sunday morning I couldn\u0026rsquo;t push on anymore and turned back. On the way down I felt sad because I couldn\u0026rsquo;t summit, but I also hold no regrets on my decision, as I am hopeful that I\u0026rsquo;ll have future opportunities to summit higher.\nCerro El Plomo from afar\nAlthough growing up, as a family we would go on hikes over the years, I only became more serious about outdoors activities after graduating from MIT in 2017. That fall, I drove across the country from San Francisco back to Boston. Purchasing a National Parks Pass and visiting Zion, Grand Canyon, and Canyonlands along the way back sparked my initial interest in exploring more of the wild. I have had exposure to the outdoors, having read Into Thin Air for my eighth grade English class, and Into the Wild in High School, and having more time after undergrad allowed me to pursue this hobby more seriously. In 2018, I took a couple of more serious trips and began my financial investment in the hobby, most notably purchasing a backpack, sleeping bag, and tent 1. My ambitions also increased, hoping to attempt higher peaks and more intense treks as I began to learn more about camping, cooking, and gear management too.\nWe had an ambitious plan for the summit attempt this weekend. Mathieu Mari, another fellow exchange student in my lab at Universidad de Chile, and I joined a weekend trip, found via a Facebook Group. The plan was to meet at Valle Nevado (3000m) at 8am on Saturday, and hike to our campsite, Refugio Federacion (4150m) by the afternoon. The next day, we would begin our summit attempt at 4am, hoping to reach the summit (5424m) by 1pm, and then descend to the campsite, pack up our gear, and return to Valle Nevado by sunset. We would then drive back down to Santiago (600m) to begin the next work week as usual.\nThis was a hike that I was looking forward to for a long time. Since last summer, prior to coming to Santiago de Chile, I had spent my evenings reading about the Andes summits in the area. Cerro El Plomo, with its snow-capped peaks, is the highest mountain visible from Santiago. Every day as I walked or biked around the city, I could see the mountain glistening in the distance, teasing me to a summit attempt.\nUnfortunately, this did not go as planned for me, as I succumbed to altitude sickness once again. Having learned from past experience, I hiked very conservatively and slowly on the first day. As one of the slowest members of the group, I actively told my body not to overwork itself. However, still ended up throwing up at 3600m halfway to the Refugio, and after the others lightened my load the rest of the way to the campsite, I threw up again at the campsite. Food was not going in my body, and I ate a small dinner somewhat expecting that a third vomit would happen overnight, and slept very soon after arriving at the campsite.\n Sunset at Refugio Federacion, our campsite at 4100m. Marmolejo, the southernmost 6000m mountain in the world, can be seen in the distance.\nI wasn\u0026rsquo;t expecting myself to be able to wake up the next morning for the summit push at 4am, but I woke up around 3am feeling better than expected. Surprisingly I did not vomit overnight, and I had more energy than to sleep in and do nothing, but I also didn\u0026rsquo;t think I had enough energy to make it all the way. Nonetheless, I joined the rest of the group for the summit push, hiking very slowly at the back. I slowly meandered up the mountain for two hours, each step harder than the one before. Going up for the summit attempt I wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure how hard I should push myself since on one hand having the mental strength will get you to the peak but on the other hand pushing yourself over the limit in these situations can be really dangerous. In the end, close to 4500m, I decided to turn back.\nI arrived at the campsite at around 730am as the first rays of the next day began climbing over the Andes to the east. I slept for another four hours, and woke up feeling fairly refreshed and more adapted to the altitude. With nothing else to do, I packed the tent and headed back down to Valle Nevado. If this were a three day trip, maybe the following day I would have been able to push for the summit. I really did want to make it to the top, where I could see Aconcagua, Tupungato, and the other dry Andes greats. But that will have to wait.\n       --  -- \n -- Mathieu made it to the top, for whom I am very happy for. In the end, five of the eight of our group summited. Mathieu later told me that summiting was probably the hardest physical activity he had ever done in his life. And Ignacio told me in the car ride back, while Gabriel was vomiting by the roadside, that he summited but at a great physical sacrifice. I spoke to another group at Refugio Federacion, who successfully summited this time, though also after a failed first attempt.\nAfter this hike, I think my body is not as adept at high altitude. Adding to last summer\u0026rsquo;s shortcomings (the Mt. Fuji trip canceled because of a typhoon, and failing to reach Siguniang\u0026rsquo;s 5000m summit after succumbing to altitude sickness at 4400m), I need to rethink my approach and probably take a slower, more conservative plan for the future. I did achieve a new personal altitude record and I was self-supporting the whole trip, an improvement over Signuiang when I was ferried down by a horse the second day. But while my personal altitude record is over 4400m, I struggle to remember what is the highest mountain I\u0026rsquo;ve summited \u0026ndash;probably Volcan Villarica in January 2019 at 2847m.\nIs hiking success binary? Did I \u0026ldquo;fail\u0026rdquo; because I didn\u0026rsquo;t summit? Am I just bad at this? Or should I have planned better? Should I have slept more on Friday night, or maybe slept at altitude to acclimate? Why do I even enjoy mountaineering, when I feel more suffering than pleasure at altitude, when I risk brain damage and cannot properly socialize during the trip?\nWhy even climb mountains? Because they\u0026rsquo;re there as George Mallory famously said. I want to keep coming back. Even as visitors of US National Parks do not accurately reflect demographics of the United States, I want to contribute to the diversity. I want to challenge myself, to push myself to new limits. But I also am unsure how I want to balance my mountaineering and outdoor interests with my work, currently my research in Chile, and my other interests. Am I working hard enough on my actual work, making progress in my research, or am I spending too much time pursuing these hobbies? What kind $\\cdot$ of $\\cdot$ person $\\cdot$ do I want to become?\nPor que hacemos montanas, cuando solo nos sentimos sufriendo? \nIt would be nice to close this entry with some closure, with some finality in direction of where I want to head. But I really don\u0026rsquo;t have a good answer for that at the moment. 2019 has been a great year in South America so far, and I am definitely enjoying my experiences in the moment. Hopefully with more focus I\u0026rsquo;ll have a better idea of where to head. And everything should work out in the end :)\n\n I plan on writing more about this in a future blog post!

During the MIT undergraduate semesters, which was one of the best times of my life, I had a lot on my plate, from rushing problem set deadline to photography event to party \u0026ndash;it was the work-hard, play-hard lifestyle. But I also was a MIT student, one who tried to take advantage of the school\u0026rsquo;s offering as much as I could \u0026ndash;and in the past fifteen months, I\u0026rsquo;ve had a lot more time discovering my interests and what are my passions.\nOne of those aspects has been hiking, and exploring the outdoors. I drove back from San Francisco to Boston in November / December 2017, and my love for nature began as we bought a national parks pass as we meandered through Utah, Arizona, and Colorado. Since then, I haven\u0026rsquo;t turned back, and this blog post documents some of my adventures.\nMost of my workouts and outdoorsy adventures are logged on Strava (where you should follow me!).\n\nJanuary: The Jay Peak Backcountry Skiing Trip In January 2018, I went with MITOC Winter school and completed my first backcountry skiing trip.

I personally found Acadia a bit underwhelming as a national park, especially compared to the sheer magnitude of Grand Canyon, but the views of the ocean from the mountain are quite unique in itself.\nViews from Acadia, May 2018\nJune: The Presidential Traverse The longest hike I\u0026rsquo;ve ever completed, the Presidential Traverse was an epic sixteen-hour, nineteen-mile adventure. I went with Anish \u0026amp; Ashay Athalye, David Lazar \u0026amp; Joanna, and Max Kessler. I ate four bagels, drank over 5L of water, and had a blast.\nOn top of Mt. Eisenhower with Washington in the background; June 2018\nAugust: Mt Siguniang in China I took a trip to Asia this summer, visiting Japan and China. Originally some friends and I wanted to hike Mt. Fuji, but unfortunately there was a typhoon when we visited. In China, I went with my sister and Liang Zhou to Sichuan, where we hiked Siguniang Mountain (四姑娘山). The logistics for getting there was quite an adventure, as hiking in China was not very well documented. I found a driver to drive us from Chengdu to Rilong town via WeChat, and we did not find a guide for hiking the mountain until arriving there. I found Eylene Pirez\u0026rsquo;s post rather helpful for logistics. The mountain consists of four peaks, in which we were attempting the \u0026ldquo;elder sister peak\u0026rdquo; at an elevation of 5025m / 16486ft. I succumbed to altitude sickness at 14,400ft, though my sister and Liang made it to the peak! This was a great cultural experience, and also one where I learned a lot more about the effects of altitude sickness.\nInside our tent at 14.500ft; Aug 2018\n -- At the summit of the eldest sister, with the highest peak, the glaciated youngest sister in the distance; Aug 2018\nSeptember: White Mountain Trips In the early fall, I made two trips up to the white mountains again.

Liberty.\nOn top of Mt Liberty; Sept 2018\nNovember: Snoqualmie Mountain with Sam Judd In November, I took a trip to Seattle for job interviews. I stayed the long weekend in Seattle to see friends, and I also knew that I had to get a Pacific Northwest hike in. I had heard so many good things about the hiking in Seattle, and, considering it as a city I may move to, I wanted to see how I would enjoy the outdoors. Sam Judd and I went urban exploring and visited Vance Creek Bridge, and we hiked Snoqualmie Mountain the next day.\nSnoqualmie Mountain was truly a unique hike. Though the length was only 1.5 miles from trailhead to summit, the vertical elevation gain was over 3000ft, resulting in a average gradient of 37%. We transitioned from a early-winter condition with light snow at the trailhead, to a full-on wintry hike with two feet of snow at the top. I was also underdressed for this hike, wearing my running shoes, and only able to glissade down the mountain, but the view on top, with Rainier rising above all so majestically, was unparalleled on such a beautiful day.\nRainier rising above the rest; Nov 2018\nNovember: Adams Winter Hike My final hike this year (or maybe this post will be updated over winter break!) was over thanksgiving, when I went with Luke Schaeffer, Anish \u0026amp; Ashay Athalye, my sister and her labmate Matt, and Frederik Mallman.

I thought I\u0026rsquo;d try to consolidate my thoughts and interests on urban planning and related topics in this blog post. Growing up, I\u0026rsquo;ve always had an interest in transportation related topics. Whether it be city planning, trains (mass transit or high-speed rail), airplanes, or cars, my interests have drifted in and out of these areas.\nClapham North, one of the two remaining stations in the London Underground with a true deep-tube island platform.

I find work by the Senseable City Lab or research by people like Cathy Wu to be very inspiring. Industry options like Sidewalk Labs or Cruise  are places that I may wish to work at in the future.\nThat said, while I am not working on my research, I do spend time reading and thinking about these topics.

Maybe working on railway scheduling problems or algorithms to design traffic intersections in the advent of self driving cars would be interesting. To this note, I\u0026rsquo;ve also been working in what direction I can head in the future. On the more policy or design-oriented field would be Urban Studies, such as MIT\u0026rsquo;s department of Urban Studies and Planning. There is also work in the Civil and Environmental Engineering Departments, and Operations Research is also an area where research is done in this area. Finally, controls and algorithms will be useful for these problems, to which Computer Science departments may also have work in this area.

It\u0026rsquo;s nice to have money stored in a bank rather than having to carry cash around, make purchases on the internet, and certain banks also offer nice interest rates so your money will grow by just sitting there.\nThere are two main types of bank accounts.\nThe first, a checkings account is essentially a digital wallet. Your checkings account will usually come with a debit card that you can use to spend from your checkings account. Usually checkings accounts do not offer interests, since there are no restrictions to how many withdrawals you can make.\nThe second kind is a Savings Account. With this account type, you might only be able to withdraw 6 times a month, with an upper bound of how much money you can take out. However, as the bank gains some amount of long-term consistency on your money, they will also give you higher interest rates. At a 1% interest rate, leaving $10,000 in your savings account will earn you $100 a year.\nBasically, only money that you need to spend in the short term should be in your checkings account. All of your other financial worth can be in your savings account, or in investments (mentioned below).\nNerdwallet has a nice page on the best savings accounts. I recently opened a GS Bank Online Savings account, which offers a 1.2% annual interest.\nBank of America is good for checkings accounts since they have a lot of ATMs across the country for cash withdrawal, and there is also a BoA office at MIT.\nMaximizing Reward Programs / Discounts  open all the loyalty programs, and receive extra points in addition to your normal spending habits\n Nerdwallet has a nice summary of beginner tips for maximizing points and miles here. I\u0026rsquo;ll give a quick summary of that page below:\n Sign up for airline loyalty programs. If you\u0026rsquo;re going to fly Delta anyway, might as well get miles for it (which will eventially translate into free flights) Sign up for airline dining programs. You can \u0026ldquo;double dip\u0026rdquo; when dining out by earning airline miles in addition to credit card rewards. For example, dosa factory in Boston offers 3 miles/$ in addition to your 3% cash back credit card for dining (so that\u0026rsquo;s 6% off). Use OpenTable to make dining reservations (you get a $20 gift card after making ~20 reservations) and Restaurant.com for discounts at restaurants you want to go to (for example, you can buy a $10 Beantown Taquiera credit for only $4). Make purchases through online shopping portals. Click through one of the online mileage malls and you’ll automatically get points or miles for every dollar you spend. If you buy an iPhone, use the United shopping portal to go to Apple\u0026rsquo;s website, and also earn extra 700 miles.  Blogs to follow Here are some blogs that I recommend following for maximizing rewards:\n Thepointsguy is a very useful blog that provides useful information on travel perks and maximizing rewards. I essentially followed this beginner\u0026rsquo;s guide to create this blog post. Nerdwallet offers good advice on credit cards, bank accounts, and investing brokers. Travel Pirates is a nice blog that has links to cheap travel deals.  Investing Note: Please keep in mind that my observations are from an amateur perspective; investing carries its risks and make sure you have done your research before making purchases!\nThe idea is that, if you have extra money lying around, if you leave it in cash, after a year it will have the same face value. Leaving it in a bank can have it grow by 1% a year. Investing [in stocks] might yield more growth, but also risk losing money.\nI won\u0026rsquo;t detail investment strategy in this blog post, but I\u0026rsquo;ll mention some companies through which you can invest your money.\nTo buy stocks, you usually need to go through Brokers. I recommend Robinhood since it has no commission on trades.\nYou may also want to make investments through an IRA (individual retirement account). With tax deductions, you can earn more on your investments. The two main types of IRAs are the Roth and Traditional, as compared below:\n    Roth Traditional     Maximum Annual Salary $118k none   Maximum Annual Contribution $5,500 $5,500   Tax taxed before contribution\ninvestment earnings aren\u0026rsquo;t taxed deductible before contribution\ninvestment earnings are taxed    A safe investment option for IRAs is to buy S\u0026amp;P 500 ETFs (for example through Vanguard, which is essentially taking a neutral stance on the market.\n Basically, get a ROTH IRA account while you are still a poor student.\n Recently, Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum have been hot investment topics, with Bitcoin fourfolding this calendar year and Ethereum tenfolding. You can use Coinmarketcap to follow the cryptocurrencies, and invest through 3rd parties like Coinbase or LibertyX.\nBlogs to follow -- Conclusion These are some tips that I\u0026rsquo;ve spent time researching, hopefully they are helpful for you too.\nIf you have any questions, feel free to contact me and I love talking about these things!\n","date":1503253182,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1503253182,"objectID":"519fc0302b5458dfd20094e434ac8185","permalink":"/post/moneybasics/","publishdate":"2017-08-20T14:19:42-04:00","relpermalink":"/post/moneybasics/","section":"post","summary":"Tips on banking accounts, IRAs, and mileage programs","tags":["blog"],"title":"Tips on Basic Financial Management","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Hello, this is my first blog post in a while :) I\u0026rsquo;ll keep to a minimalist writing style so reading this blog can be as fast and as helpful as possible.\nCredit Cards A credit card is a payment system. When you use a credit card to buy an item, you are effectively borrowing money from the bank, and you can pay the bank back within a subsequent 25-30 day period.\nA credit card is offered by a bank (Bank of America, Chase). Visa and MasterCard are payment networks.\nWhy should I get one?  Build your credit score Fraud protection: if you purchased a fradulent item, and you want to cancel the purchase, with a credit card, you can call the bank and get your money back (the bank assumes the risk). However, if you purchase such item with a debit card or cash, your money has been spent and cannot be retrieved. Rewards: many credit cards may offer 2% cash back, which means you are saving money every time you buy an item. Foreign Transaction Fees: if you travel frequently, there are credit cards with no foreign transaction fees, which might be a better exchange rate than going to a counter. (Though, different credit card networks may offer different conversion rates).  Why shouldn\u0026rsquo;t I get one?  Tendencies to overspend with credit cards lead to debt accumulation Interest rates for paying the debt are very high. If you pay on time, though, there is no debt.  Things to look for when choosing a credit card  Is there an annual fee? Usually the credit cards with better rewards also have an annual fee ($95/year), so if your spending Foreign transaction fees? When using a credit card abroad, you may be charged up to 3% extra for the purchase. However, this fee is waived for many cards. Signup bonus? Some credit cards may offer 30,000 miles (or cashback) for the first $1000 you spend in the first 3 months of opening a card, which may be a tremendous value! Rewards? This is the key part of credit cards -taking advantage of the rewards! Whether you prefer cashback, airline miles, AMC movie discounts, etc, you should choose a card that best fits your needs.  Which credit cards should I get? As I am a student, the credit cards that I\u0026rsquo;m mentioning are targeted towards my spending category.\nGeneral Usage These credit cards have rewards that are\nBy far, I\u0026rsquo;d highly recommend the Citi Double Cash Card. You get 2% cash back on every single purchase with no restrictions. No annual fees, but there is a foreign transaction fee.\n(However I think the fineprint states that to get the 2nd percent cash back, you must wait for the transaction to be confirmed before you pay back. Essentially, wait a while before you actually make your credit card payment for this card.)\nI\u0026rsquo;m currently using the Chase Freedom Unlimited, which offers 1.5% cash back, and no annual fees. This credit card also offers $175 back for the first $500 you spend in the past 3 months, so it\u0026rsquo;s better than the Citibank card for up to the first $35,000.\nI also have the BankAmericard® Better Balance Rewards™ Credit Card. You essentially get $100 caskback every year as long as you pay in full, so it\u0026rsquo;s a nice credit card to have to get the flat rewards. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if it\u0026rsquo;s offered anymore, though.\nAirline Rewards These are the cards that generally I\u0026rsquo;d apply to, and then CANCEL them once I get the initial rewards so you don\u0026rsquo;t get charged the annual fee.\nI currently have the Delta Gold SkyMiles card. Currently, you earn 30k miles (roughly $400) for the first $1k you spend, which is a 40% discount rate! You also get 1 free check-in baggage when flying Delta, and priority boarding, and no foreign transaction fees. The annual fee of $95 is waived the first year, so be sure to cancel it in the first year :)\nKeep in mind that the initial miles bonus varies over time (I got 60k miles when I applied), so you may also want to wait for a better miles deal.\nI also had the American Airlines Citibank credit card. You also earn 30k miles for the first $1k you spend, plus similar perks with the Delta credit card. I got the initial bonus, and cancelled it because of the annual fee. However, holding onto the credit card is still nice because I can show the card to the gate attendants at the airport and occasionally get priority boarding.\nAnd of course, there\u0026rsquo;s the United Chase credit card. Currently you get 40k miles for the first $1k you spend, and similar perks and annual fee. I don\u0026rsquo;t have this yet.\nIf you fly other airlines more frequently, feel free to look up their credit cards and their perks.\nGeneral Tips  Setup autopay from your bank account, and always pay in full Get a credit card as early as possible to build your credit score It\u0026rsquo;s okay to have multiple credit cards open, but make sure you keep track of the finances in such cards.  Conclusion Thanks for reading! This is meant to be an introduction to credit cards, so I didn\u0026rsquo;t go into many of the rewards details (technically the Chase credit card reimburses you in Chase UltimateReward points which then you can convert to cash, or miles).\nI\u0026rsquo;ll try to write on Investing (Robinhood, Bitcoin, Vanguard, RothIRA) next time.\n","date":1501804800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1501804800,"objectID":"b07cc113e076eb514a8f19b25a36a7d4","permalink":"/post/creditcard/","publishdate":"2017-08-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/creditcard/","section":"post","summary":"Your introduction on how to choose a credit card and which one you should get!\n","tags":["blog"],"title":"Tips on Credit Cards","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" For my senior year at MIT, I participated in the MIT SuperUROP program as a MITRE Undergraduate Research and Innovation Scholar.

The bitcoin lightning is a peer-to-peer system that allows transactions between parties to be conducted off the main blockchain, reducing transaction costs.\nAbstract With regular Bitcoin transactions, low-value, high-frequency payments are increasingly impractical due to increasingly significant mining fees that must be paid with each transaction. The Bitcoin Lightning Network is an extension to Bitcoin that allows two parties to create a payment channel between themselves, allowing payments to be made without committing many transactions to the blockchain, thus avoiding substantial mining fees. However, these payments still cannot be smaller than a satoshi, the smallest unit of Bitcoin.

In this paper, we construct models for the direct bi-directional classification of speech and images, inspired by a few research papers. We experiment with architectures of two convolutional neural networks, one on the TIDIGITS data set (audio) and the other on the MNIST data set (visual), to obtain joint representations of single digits from spoken utterances and images.
