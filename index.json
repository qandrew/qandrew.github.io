    "description": "A mesmerizing experience
",
    "body": "I had been wanting to see a solar eclipse since when I first learned about them in first grade, and I distinctly remember in second grade while I was doing 体操 at 图强二小, I would look up directly at the sun, hoping to see an eclipse, and my mind would play games with me simulating how an eclipse may look. As a relatively rare natural phenomenon, occurring once every 18 months in a very lucky region of the world, it had always been my dream to witness one. I saw the partial eclipse in Hanian in 2009 and I was in Boston during the Great American Eclipse in 2017.\nAs I am spending this year as a Fulbright scholar in Santiago de Chile, one of my motivating reasons to come to Chile was the possibility to see the solar eclipse in July 2019, fulfilling a lifelong dream.\nAnd thus on July 1st, 2019, I drove up with friends Evan Yao, Tom Benavides, Lulu Russell, and Shannon Wing to La Serena from Santiago de Chile. We spent the night camping in the valley between La Serena and Vicuña tracing the path of totality.\nBeing new moon before the total eclipse, we went out to see the stars, and boy was it amazing. Setting up my Sony for some long exposures, I got pictures of the milky way Nebulas, as my camera saw more than the naked eye. Those were definitely the best night photos I have ever taken, and potentially the best stars I have ever seen. After doing some light paintings, we called it a night, excited for the next morning.\n The night sky the night before  The next morning, we drove to Pisco Elqui along the Ruta de las Estrellas having passed by Gabriela Mistral's hometown. Valle del Elqui is known for its lush green basins in contrast with the barren desert mountains, where much of Chilean Pisco is produced. We stopped by at a artenesal Pisco distillery, and after a quick tour and the purchase of two really smooth piscos, we drove off knowing that we didn't have too much time to hike a mountain to see the eclipse.\nWe found a hill that according to our Gaia topo map had a clear view out west. We hiked until around 3:45pm when the eclipse was beginning. Choosing a nice prominent rock to sit at, we settled, and took out the eclipse glasses to witness the first contact. We had around an hour until totality, enjoying the view of the drier northern Andes, and conversing while Lulu and Shannon took some creative pictures of their mascot Freddie. I set up my gorillapod to record video on my GS8 while I also played around with camera settings on my A7iii with my double ND filters to try to get pictures of the eclipse without burning the sensor itself.\n   Totality began to approach. We could definitely feel the temperature dropping, and the brightness dimming too as the moon began to cover the sun. I couldn't really explain the lights though it felt like the contrast increased. I had my camera gear set up, with my phone taking on video responsibilities, while I took off my ND filters and prepared my camera settings for the eclipse solar.\nI don't really remember the transition super clearly, as I was probably looking through my A7iii e-viewfinder when at the worst possible time my camera froze. Holy fuck I yelled, recorded in the video, probably damaging the tranquility and serenity of the moment, but as much as the holy fuck was directed towards malfunctioning tech, it was hopefully also towards the magnificence of the eclipse itself. Looking up and instead of seeing the bright sun, seeing this ring of light with a black center was the most, absolutely most, surreal experience I've had (while not on drugs or alcohol). Looking around, seeing the town below us in night lights, looking at the horizon and seeing sunrise/sunset colors, and looking up at the sky where one could see stars and the sun at the same time. And boy oh boy did those two minutes pass so quickly. Fortunatly I got my A7iii working again and I got some nice pictures at my 75mm zoom of the sun transitioning back to normality.\n   The total eclipse  There was so much to see, too many things to see at once that you had to pick your poision. I didn't get to see the transition from light to dark or dark to light, the speedy shadows sweeping across the valley over the mountains plunging the community below into darkness. Or I didn't get to take a panorama of the eclipse, a shot that I think Evan got. Two mintues were also way too short to take in the eclipse in full, and now I understand why the statistic of the length of the eclipse is so special -not all eclipses are created alike. I didn't really take in the 360 view of the eclipse as I was mostly focused on photography and looking at the sun itself rather than the views that the sun produced. There was so much to see and so little time.\nImmediately after the eclipse, I immediately craved for the next eclipse, almost like a drug. This was such a high, such a naturally created unnatural high, that I just wanted more.\n And thus we began our hike back down to reality. After cleaning up our shoes and resting for a bit, we hit the road, only to be met by gridlock traffic on Ruta 41. We found an asado roadside, locals who were quite nice, bought food from them, and also camped in their farm from 9pm to 1am, hoping to avoid the traffic. We set up tent and called it an earlier night.\nWe left the farm at 1am and we drove until La Serena. Gas stations we passed by were either closed, having been completely depleted after the eclipse, or with lines fortnights long. The drive along Ruta 5 was smooth for the first hour or so, though we soon began observing a lot of stopped cars roadside, almost in an apocalyptic fashion, wondering why people were sleeping on the side of the road. However, as we passed more and more cars road side, we also noticed more and more cars ahead of us, eventually reaching a density of stop and go traffic. I knew that I was hitting my safety limit, and during some stop-and-gos I could clearly notice that my ability to shift into first declined. After a couple of stalls, I pulled over too and we napped for two hours.\nThere was more traffic when we woke up to the rising sun, but eventually it cleared. Finally arriving back to Santiago, the normally 5 hour drive turned 10. The traffic was almost as unique of an experience as the eclipse itself. Although the traffic was quite bad, later Evan and I were discussing, and we both agreed that we'd easily sacrifice 20 hours of traffic for such a unique experience. As they would say in Spanish, vale la pena.\nTwo headlights shine through the sleepless night ",

    "description": "A transit-oriented description of how to get around a city
",
    "body": "Hi! As a passionate transit-oriented teen, I wanted to write this blog post to detail how multi-modal transportation options can be used to best fit one's transportation needs. For context, I am currently a student based in Santiago de Chile (May 2019).\nHere are my realistic transportation options:\n I could either walk or run, as my human-powered mobility options. I could bike (or ride an electric scooter, skateboard etc), if I owned these micromobility options. I could also use dockless bikes (such as Mobikes), docked bikes (Bike Santiago) and dockless scooters (such as Lime, Scoot, and other local companies) for shared micromobility options. I could ride the subway or bus in Santiago for public transit options. For my vehicle-for-hire options, I can ride a taxi, or call an Uber. Finally, for my auto-oriented options, I could rent a car, or I could own one. (unrealistic and undesirable).  Here, I am not considering other unrealistic forms of transit, such as helicopters, horses, teleportation, etc.\nI am considering the monetary and temporal costs as my main factors. Though running or biking accrues amortized cost of purchasing shoes or bikes respectively, for this example I will not factor it in. Other factors in the decision process may include environmental costs (cars pollute the most!), social appropriateness (for example, running to a formal event probably is not the best idea), laziness, or even the weather.\nExample One: Commuting    One's daily commute is usually the most important and consequential transit decision. I currently live near the Santa Isabel Metro station on line 5 (green), lucky to have good transit options near me. While Santiago's bus network has quite good coverage, buses are generally not preferred to rail transit. Thus, I consider the Beauchef campus of University of Chile in a transit desert because it takes at least ten minutes to walk to the closest subway station.\nHere are my daily commute options:\n walking: The shortest distance is about 2.5 miles or 4 kilometers, which would require about 45 minutes. There is no monetary cost. running1:. I can complete the run in about 20 minutes, with no monetary cost either. I will arrive at work sweaty, which is either a plus given that I got a workout in, or a minus given that I'll need to shower. biking:  If I own my bike or electric scooter, there is no daily monetary cost, and it takes around 15 minutes. I could also rent a bike or participate in a bikeshare program, though there is no convenient docked or dockless solution at the moment2.   public transit: There is no one-seat metro ride, so I could take the metro from Santa Isabel to Republica, and then either walk or take the bus to my final destination. Walking or taking the bus at the end takes the same amount of time for me. The monetary cost is 800 CLP (or about 1.20 USD) during rush hour, for a journey of about 30-40 minutes depending on traffic. taxi or rideshare: The time cost varies from 10-30 minutes depending on traffic, and the cost is about 3000 CLP or (4.50 USD).  Winner: Biking is my preferred daily transit option. With a decent amount of bike lanes in Santiago, I feel safe choosing this option. Biking also is the fastest and least expensive option, making it a no-brainer for me. Rain is infrequent in the city, and winters aren't too cold making this commute option appropriate for the city all year round.\nOf course, I could also work from home.\nExample Two: Eating out    A few months ago, my parents visited and I met them for dinner at Mestizo, a very tasty and reasonably priced restaurant in Vitacura. Located in Parque Bicentenario, the open-air restaurant provided picturesque views of sunset facing Sanhattan, and we had a pleasant experience. However the restaurant is also in a transit desert \u0026ndash;and how exactly should I go there?\n Walking and running: not realistic due to the distance and the social circumstance. Running would about 40 minutes. biking: I do not trust parking my bike outside in Santiago, precluding this option. I could use a bikeshare, though riding on a slower MoBike would take about 35 minutes and leave myself sweaty. public transit: this option requires a metro transfer to a bus. Due to the location of the restaurant, the journey is 40 minutes with a cost of $800 CLP. Uber: this is probably the simplest option, taking 17 minutes (maybe 30 in rush hour traffic) with a cost of about $3800.  Winner: a combination of metro and micromobility. I took the metro to Los Leones (15min), and then I rode a Lime scooter the rest of the way (10min). The total cost was about $2800 (800 for metro and 2000 for Lime), as the scooters in Chile are quite expensive relative to other transit forms, but I had fun and this was also the most eco-friendly. Unfortunately Google maps does not currently provide multi-modal routing, but I believe this combination of transit options is the best overall value.\nGeneral Thoughts I hope the two examples above illustrate the many transit options. Transit is a personal choice, depending on one's preferences towards time, money, environmentally friendliness, or simply knowledge of options. I personally am of the millenial generation, preferring not to use cars, though I also understand that for some people driving may be the best option. As micro-mobility and last-mile transit options increase, and as people prefer to live in cities over suburbs, hopefully though a combination of public transit and micro-mobility options we can reduce our dependency of cars and cut carbon emissions.\nHere are some examples where micro-mobility options can be the best:\n I go to a bar, and I want to return home late at night. The bar is about a mile away. I could take the metro (800CLP), an Uber (2000CLP), or ride a Mobike back (400CLP)3. I choose the last option, as I am sober enough, the neighborhood is safe, and I prefer the cheapest option as my value of time is low at night. I'm shopping at a supermarket. The supermarket is about twenty minutes from my house, which is a bit long for walking, so I could also call an Uber (1200CLP) or rent a Mobike (400CLP). I bike back, with the front basket carrying my groceries.  That said, I also have some questions about micromobility\u0026hellip;\n Can this be a social activity? For example, while it is socially acceptable to go on a date via an Uber, could one do so on a Lime Scooter? How can this be more of an inclusive tech? Dockless options allow for scooters and bikes to move to less affluent neighborhoods than docked bikes, though how can roads be designed to allow cyclists and scooter riders to feel safer? Can older people or children feel comfortable using this tech too, even if they aren't the main market?  Thanks for reading! And please feel free to reach out if you had any thoughts too 😊\n  I've actually done this once!.\u0026#8617;\n Both Mobike and Limebike are not permitted to operate in Santiago Central, the region where my university lies.\u0026#8617;\n I would not have used my personal bike to go to the bar, because in a group setting we often do not know where we will go next, thus it would be inconvenient socially to drag along a bike.\u0026#8617;\n   ",

    "description": "A second failed high altitude ascent leaves me questioning my abilities and intentions.
",
    "body": "I did not summit Cerro El Plomo this past weekend.\nClosing the trip on Sunday night, in Rodrigo's car we descended back down to Santiago from our trailhead, the ski resort of Valle Nevado, at 3000m. The drive back down was a spectacular solace \u0026ndash;up in the mountains, over two kilometers above Chile's primary metropolis, you could see glimpses of the sea of lights peeking between mountain canyons, contrasting the clean clear air and the celestial sky in the highlands with urban civilization, cosmopolitanism, and reality down below. I was a kilometer away from being as close to heaven as I possibly could have been \u0026ndash;the summit standing at a proud 5424m \u0026ndash;when during my summit attempt on Sunday morning I couldn't push on anymore and turned back. On the way down I felt sad because I couldn't summit, but I also held no regrets on my decision, as I am hopeful that I'll have future opportunities to summit higher.\nCerro El Plomo from afar Although growing up, as a family we went on hikes over the years, I only became more serious about outdoors activities after graduating in 2017. That fall, I drove across the country from San Francisco back to Boston. Purchasing a National Parks Pass and visiting Zion, Grand Canyon, and Canyonlands along the way back sparked my initial interest in exploring more of the wild. I have had exposure to the outdoors, having read Into Thin Air for my eighth grade English class and Into the Wild in High School, and having more time after undergrad allowed me to pursue this hobby more seriously. In 2018, I took a couple of more serious trips and began my financial investment in the hobby, most notably purchasing a backpack, sleeping bag, and tent 1. My ambitions also increased, hoping to attempt higher peaks and more intense treks as I began to learn more about camping, cooking, and gear management.\nCerro El Plomo had been on my radar in the months preceding this hike. Since last summer, prior to coming to Santiago de Chile, I had spent my evenings reading about the Andes summits in the area. Cerro El Plomo, with its snow-capped peaks, is the highest mountain visible from Santiago, rising over three miles above the city basin. Every day as I walked or biked around the city, I could see the mountain glistening in the distance, teasing me to a summit attempt.\nWe had an ambitious plan for the summit attempt this weekend. Mathieu Mari, another fellow exchange student in my lab at Universidad de Chile, and I joined a weekend trip, found via a Facebook Group. The plan was to meet at Valle Nevado (3000m) at 8am on Saturday, and hike to our campsite, Refugio Federacion (4150m) by the afternoon. The next day, we would begin our summit attempt at 4am, hoping to reach the summit (5424m) by 1pm, and then descend to the campsite, pack up our gear, and return to Valle Nevado by sunset. We would then drive back down to Santiago (600m) to begin the next work week as usual.\nUnfortunately, this did not go as planned for me, as I succumbed to altitude sickness once again. Having learned from past experience, I hiked very conservatively and slowly on the first day. As one of the slowest members of the group, I actively told my body not to overwork itself. However, I still ended up throwing up at 3600m halfway to the Refugio, and after the others lightened my load the rest of the way to the campsite, I threw up again at the campsite. Food was not going in my body, and I ate a small dinner somewhat expecting that a third vomit would happen overnight, and slept very soon after arriving at the campsite.\n Sunset at Refugio Federacion, our campsite at 4100m. Marmolejo, the southernmost 6000m mountain in the world, can be seen in the distance. I wasn't expecting myself to wake up the next morning for the summit push at 4am, but I woke up around 3am feeling better than expected. Surprisingly I did not vomit overnight, and I had more energy than to sleep in and do nothing, but I also didn't think I had enough energy to make it all the way. Nonetheless, I joined the rest of the group for the summit push, hiking very slowly at the back. I slowly meandered up the mountain for two hours, each step harder than the one before. Going up for the summit attempt I wasn't sure how hard I should push myself since on one hand having the mental strength will get me to the peak but on the other hand pushing myself over the limit in these situations can be really dangerous. In the end, close to 4500m, I decided to turn back.\nI arrived at the campsite at around 730am as the first rays of the next day began climbing over the Andes to the east. I slept for another four hours, and woke up feeling fairly refreshed and more adapted to the altitude. With nothing else to do, I packed the tent and headed back down to Valle Nevado. If this were a three day trip, maybe the following day I would have been able to push for the summit. I really did want to make it to the top, where I could see Aconcagua, Tupungato, and the other dry Andes greats. But that will have to wait.\n Mathieu made it to the top, for whom I am very happy for. In the end, five of the eight of our group summited. Mathieu later told me that summiting was probably the hardest physical activity he has ever done in his life. And Ignacio told me in the car ride back, while Gabriel was vomiting by the roadside, that he summited \u0026ndash;but at a great physical sacrifice. I spoke to another group at Refugio Federacion, who successfully summited this time, though also after a failed first attempt.\nAfter this hike, I think my body is not as adept at high altitude. Adding to last summer's shortcomings (the Mt. Fuji trip canceled because of a typhoon, and failing to reach Siguniang's 5000m summit after succumbing to altitude sickness at 4400m), I need to rethink my approach and probably take a slower, more conservative plan for the future. I did achieve a new personal altitude record and I was self-supporting the whole trip, an improvement over Signuiang when I was ferried down by a horse the second day. But while my personal altitude record is over 4400m, I struggle to remember what is the highest mountain I've summited \u0026ndash;probably Volcan Villarica in January 2019 at 2847m.\nIs hiking success binary? Did I \u0026ldquo;fail\u0026rdquo; because I didn't summit? Am I just bad at this? Or should I have planned better? Should I have slept more on Friday night, or maybe slept at altitude to acclimate? Why do I even enjoy mountaineering, when I feel more suffering than pleasure at altitude, when I risk brain damage and cannot properly socialize during the trip?\nWhy even climb mountains? Because they're there as George Mallory famously said. I want to keep coming back. Even as visitors of US National Parks do not accurately reflect demographics of the United States, I want to contribute to the diversity. I want to challenge myself, to push myself to new limits. But I also am unsure how I want to balance my mountaineering and outdoor interests with my work, currently my research in Chile, and my other interests. Am I working hard enough on my actual work, making progress in my research, or am I spending too much time pursuing these hobbies? What kind $\\cdot$ of $\\cdot$ person $\\cdot$ do I want to become?\nPor que hacemos montanas, cuando solo nos sentimos sufriendo?  In the end, Rodrigo dropped us off at Baquedano and I took an Uber back to my house. I quickly unpacked and called it a night, closing one weekend while awaiting for the next to come. 2019 has been a great year in South America so far, and I am definitely enjoying my experiences in the moment. Hopefully with more focus I'll have a better idea of where to head. And everything should work out in the end :)\n  I plan on writing more about this in a future blog post! Happy to always talk about gear for hiking.\u0026#8617;\n   ",

    "description": "A list of crypto related projects
",
    "body": "Below is a series of summaries of my research in cryptography while I was a student at MIT.\nImplementation of a Practical Leakage-Resilient ID Scheme (2016-2018) For my senior year at MIT, I participated in the MIT SuperUROP program as a MITRE Undergraduate Research and Innovation Scholar. My research topic was Implementing Leakage Resilient, Public Key Authentication Systems for Embedded Devices, working with Utsav Banerjee, Chiraag Juvekar and Prof. Anantha Chandrakasan.\nThis work was presented at EECScon. An extension of this work, with my collaborators, is currently in submission.\nAbstract Having an effective and convenient authentication system is necessary for the future development and increased usage of devices in the Internet of Things. This paper presents the implementation of a pairings-based, public key leakage resilient authentication system to improve upon current authentication schemes. We have developed a pairings library in C, and we have implemented software in RISCV assembly that successfully implements such authentication scheme on a FPGA, demonstrating the feasibility and efficiency of such primitive.\nMy paper can be found here.\nProbabilistic Lightning (Spring 2017) For our 6.857 (network security) final project, in a group project with Jamie Bloxham, Gina Yuan, and Justine Jang, we implemented probabilistic payments on the bitcoin lightning project. The bitcoin lightning is a peer-to-peer system that allows transactions between parties to be conducted off the main blockchain, reducing transaction costs.\nAbstract With regular Bitcoin transactions, low-value, high-frequency payments are increasingly impractical due to increasingly significant mining fees that must be paid with each transaction. The Bitcoin Lightning Network is an extension to Bitcoin that allows two parties to create a payment channel between themselves, allowing payments to be made without committing many transactions to the blockchain, thus avoiding substantial mining fees. However, these payments still cannot be smaller than a satoshi, the smallest unit of Bitcoin. In this paper, we describe a scheme for probabilistic payments in the Lightning Network, which can be utilized to effectively make sub-satoshi microtransactions.\nGithub See my code and documentation here.\nOur final writeup can be found here.\nSelected Press Our project was featured on Bitcoin Tech Weekly and Reddit.\nThresholdizing Lattice-Based Encryption Schemes (2018) Below is a description of my MEng thesis, completed in 2018.\nContext / Abstract In this thesis, we apply secret sharing techniques on lattice based encryption schemes, namely fully homomorphic encryption and predicate encryption. Using secret sharing techniques from [BGG+17], we show how to construct paradigms of threshold multi-key fully homomorphic encryption and predicate encryption. Through multi-key fully homomorphic encryption and threshold fully homomorphic encryption, we can construct a low-round multi party computation (MPC) scheme with guaranteed output delivery, assuming honest majority in the semi-honest and malicious settings. Applying the secret sharing scheme on predicate encryption constructions from LWE, we can obtain a distributed predicate encryption scheme.\nMy thesis is available here.\nI would like to extend special thanks to my advisor Yael Kalai my collaborator Adam Sealfon.\nBelow, I'd like to give a high level overview of some of the cryptographic concepts. For more technical details, please see my thesis or the links to the courses below!\nSecret Sharing Secret sharing is a cryptographic protocol that involves sharing a secret among a group of participants (each receiving shares of the secret), such that the secret can only be reconstructed if a sufficient number of parties combine their shares. The motivation of this primitive is from cryptographic key management, in which storing a secret key would be more secure if split among multiple parties.\nMore formally, a secret sharing scheme has two algorithms, $Share$ and $Reconstruct$:\n $Share(s, \\mathbb{A}) \\to (s_1, \\dots s_N)$: The share algorithm takes in input secret $s$, an access structure $\\mathbb{A}$ for $N$ parties, and outputs $N$ shares in which share $s_i$ is sent to party $i$. $Reconstruct(S) \\to s$: The reconstruct algorithm takes in a set of shares $S$ such that if number of shares in $S$ is sufficient relative to the access structure, then the secret $s$ is returned. Otherwise, $\\perp$ is returned.  The properties that we want out of a secret sharing scheme are:\n Correctness: if a sufficient number of shares are given to the reconstruction algorithm, then the secret will be recovered. Security: if an insufficient number of shares are given to the reconstruction algorithm, then the secret should not be recovered.  One of the most famous examples of secret sharing is Shamir's Secret Sharing Scheme which uses the elegant idea of polynomial interpolation to achieve correctness and privacy. A secret $s$ is simply the $y$ intercept of a degree $n-1$ polynomial $f(x)$, and party $i$ is given $f(i)$ as her share. If $n$ parties combine their shares, through polynomial interpolation it is possible to uniquely reconstruct $s$. However, if there are fewer than $n$ shares available, then it is impossible to uniquely reconstruct $f(x)$ and determine the secret!\nFully Homomorphic Encryption Fully Homomorphic Encryption is a recently realized construction which I think is really cool! In essence, it allows computation on encrypted data the same way we would compute on plaintext. An encryption scheme is a family algorithms consisting of $KeyGen$ (which generates the public and secret key, $Enc$ (which takes in as input the public key and a plaintext message and outputs a ciphertext) and $Dec$ (which uses the secret key to decrypt a ciphertext and output a message).\nIn FHE, we allow an additional $Eval$ algorithm. Assume that $ct_1 = Enc(m_1)$ and $ct_2 = Enc(m_2)$. We can generate $ct^+ = Add(ct_1, ct_2)$ such that $Dec(ct^+) = m_1 + m_2$. We can also generate $ct^* = Mul(ct_1, ct_2)$ such that $Dec(ct^+) = m_1 * m_2$. With addition and multiplication, we can simulate any circuit and this any function! In theory, if you gave your data encrypted to Google, Google could use FHE to run their algorithms on your data, and return to you the queries you desire, without them learning anything about your underlying data!\nPredicate Encryption Predicate Encryption is another type of augmentation of classical encryption schemes. A ciphertext $ct$ is now associated with a private set of attributes $x$ such that one holding a secret key $sk_C$ associated with predicate $C$ can only decrypt $ct$ if $C(x) = 1$. Predicate encryption is a generalization of attribute-based encryption but is also a special case of functional encryption.\nPredicate encryption has many interesting applications. For example, one may wish to encrypt the location of a club meeting with the attributes such that only people who can prove their identity may decrypt and discover the location.\nMy Thesis, in summary Using secret sharing techniques, we can secret share the secret key of predicate encrytion and fully homomorphic encryption schemes to allow for decentralized decryption. This means that, we can have $k$ parties output partial decryptions of a FHE or PE scheme and be able to reconstruct the output using the partial decryptions, while preserving the secrecy of the secret key shares. Applications of these techniques include low round multi-party computation and decentralized predicate encryption.\nFurther Reading For further reading, MIT's 6.857 Computer and Network Security class is a good resource to get started in cryptography. I took this class when I was an undergraduate at MIT.\nI also filmed the more theoretical cryptography class at MIT, 6.875 Cryptography and Cryptanalysis.

    "description": "Detailing some of the hiking trips this year.
",
    "body": "I should probably be writing my thesis for my MEng, but I'll start off kindling the writing part of my mind by procrastinating for a bit.\nIn the past year after I completed my undergraduate degree, I've been slowing spending more time finding more about who I am. During the MIT undergraduate semesters, which was one of the best times of my life, I had a lot on my plate, from rushing problem set deadline to photography event to party \u0026ndash;it was the work-hard, play-hard lifestyle. But I also was a MIT student, one who tried to take advantage of the school's offering as much as I could \u0026ndash;and in the past fifteen months, I've had a lot more time discovering my interests and what are my passions.\nOne of those aspects has been hiking, and exploring the outdoors. I drove back from San Francisco to Boston in November / December 2017, and my love for nature began as we bought a national parks pass as we meandered through Utah, Arizona, and Colorado. Since then, I haven't turned back, and this blog post documents some of my adventures.\nMost of my workouts and outdoorsy adventures are logged on Strava (where you should follow me!).\n January: The Jay Peak Backcountry Skiing Trip In January 2018, I went with MITOC Winter school and completed my first backcountry skiing trip. Strava Activity.\nSetting up camp that evening, sleeping in -10F was quite an experience; Jan, 2018 March: Grand Canyon \u0026amp; Utah Over spring break, Saarik Kalia, Sam Judd and I took a week to go hiking in the American Southwest before spending a degenerate weekend in Vegas. We went to Observation Point in Zion, the Navajo Trail at Bryce Canyon, Upper Calf Creek Falls by Rt 12, the Golden Cathedral in Grand Staircase, Buckskin Gulch, and the Grand Kaibab Trail in Grand Canyon.\nOn our way to a fifteen mile hike, to the Colorado river and back; Apr, 2018 My Strava record of the hike April: The Freezing Franconia Ridge Loop In April, Jason Liang visited and we decided to go on a winter hike. We chose the Franconia Ridge Loop \u0026ndash;little did we know how highly ranked this hike is. Though it was mid-April and there wasn't snow in Boston anymore, we highly underestimated the weather conditions in the whites. Underdressed, by the time we hiked above the treeline it started blizzarding. Both of us ended up with mild frostbite and lessons learned. The epitome of type II fun.\nOminous Clouds as we approach Lafayette; Apr 2018 May: Acadia In May, I went with MITOC on an Acadia trip. David Yang, Linh Nguyen, and I climbed Cadillac mountain while we were there. I personally found Acadia a bit underwhelming as a national park, especially compared to the sheer magnitude of Grand Canyon, but the views of the ocean from the mountain are quite unique in itself.\nViews from Acadia, May 2018 June: The Presidential Traverse The longest hike I've ever completed, the Presidential Traverse was an epic sixteen-hour, nineteen-mile adventure. I went with Anish \u0026amp; Ashay Athalye, David Lazar \u0026amp; Joanna, and Max Kessler. I ate four bagels, drank over 5L of water, and had a blast.\nOn top of Mt. Eisenhower with Washington in the background; June 2018 August: Mt Siguniang in China I took a trip to Asia this summer, visiting Japan and China. Originally some friends and I wanted to hike Mt. Fuji, but unfortunately there was a typhoon when we visited. In China, I went with my sister and Liang Zhou to Sichuan, where we hiked Siguniang Mountain (四姑娘山). The logistics for getting there was quite an adventure, as hiking in China was not very well documented. I found a driver to drive us from Chengdu to Rilong town via WeChat, and we did not find a guide for hiking the mountain until arriving there. I found Eylene Pirez's post rather helpful for logistics. The mountain consists of four peaks, in which we were attempting the \u0026ldquo;elder sister peak\u0026rdquo; at an elevation of 5025m / 16486ft. I succumbed to altitude sickness at 14,400ft, though my sister and Liang made it to the peak! This was a great cultural experience, and also one where I learned a lot more about the effects of altitude sickness.\nInside our tent at 14.500ft; Aug 2018 At the summit of the eldest sister, with the highest peak, the glaciated youngest sister in the distance; Aug 2018 September: White Mountain Trips In the early fall, I made two trips up to the white mountains again. The first was with MITOC through the August circus, and I spent a day hiking the Kinsmans and a day hiking Mt. Moosilauke via Beaver Brook trail.\nIn late September, I went with the MIT Theory group and we hiked Mt. Liberty.\nOn top of Mt Liberty; Sept 2018 November: Snoqualmie Mountain with Sam Judd In November, I took a trip to Seattle for job interviews. I stayed the long weekend in Seattle to see friends, and I also knew that I had to get a Pacific Northwest hike in. I had heard so many good things about the hiking in Seattle, and, considering it as a city I may move to, I wanted to see how I would enjoy the outdoors. Sam Judd and I went urban exploring and visited Vance Creek Bridge, and we hiked Snoqualmie Mountain the next day.\nSnoqualmie Mountain was truly a unique hike. Though the length was only 1.5 miles from trailhead to summit, the vertical elevation gain was over 3000ft, resulting in a average gradient of 37%. We transitioned from a early-winter condition with light snow at the trailhead, to a full-on wintry hike with two feet of snow at the top. I was also underdressed for this hike, wearing my running shoes, and only able to glissade down the mountain, but the view on top, with Rainier rising above all so majestically, was unparalleled on such a beautiful day.\nRainier rising above the rest; Nov 2018 November: Adams Winter Hike My final hike this year (or maybe this post will be updated over winter break!) was over thanksgiving, when I went with Luke Schaeffer, Anish \u0026amp; Ashay Athalye, my sister and her labmate Matt, and Frederik Mallman. With no wind on the whites, we hiked up Mt. Adams on a clear day.\nLooking higher, with Mt Madison in the background; Nov 2018  The future I will be in Chile for eight months next year so hopefully I will get some pretty hikes in and who knows where life will take me!\nThese past few months, I've also began investing more into hiking equipment. Maybe I'll make a blog post sometime writing about my gear, and what I find helpful.\n",

    "body": "Hello, and I guess I am back to [attempting to] blogging. I thought I'd try to consolidate my thoughts and interests on urban planning and related topics in this blog post. Growing up, I've always had an interest in transportation related topics. Whether it be city planning, trains (mass transit or high-speed rail), airplanes, or cars, my interests have drifted in and out of these areas.\nClapham North, one of the two remaining stations in the London Underground with a true deep-tube island platform. July, 2017 I've always found this topic very fascinating, probably due to growing up in big cities like Tokyo. Though I am a computer scientist by training, I'm hoping that I will find some area in the future where I can apply my computer science skillset in this domain. I find work by the Senseable City Lab or research by people like Cathy Wu to be very inspiring. Industry options like Sidewalk Labs or Cruise  are places that I may wish to work at in the future.\nThat said, while I am not working on my research, I do spend time reading and thinking about these topics. Below are a series of links that I've enjoyed following and reading.\nBlogs Here are some blogs that I follow (somewhat regularly):\n Pedestrian Observations: This is a blog I found some time ago that provides a lot of detailed analysis on cities and their transit planning options. CityLab: This is a news site run by the Atlantic which contains a lot of interesting posts about city-related topics. New-Urbanist Memes for Transit Oriented Teens: This is the classic high-traffic Facebook group consisting of a healthy mix of transit-related memes and fruitful discussion. (wiki). There are derivative groups that focus on bicycles, aircrafts, and other topics. Yelling at Trains: This is run by my friend Ian Reynolds, who had his live map of the Boston MBTA featured on the Boston Globe!  Airplane Related Resources I'd say that I am currently (c.2018) in a lull in terms of my aviation interests. In late 2017 I was paying close attention to United's Boeing 747 retirement event. I was interning in the San Francisco Bay Area, where the last of the Boeing 747s were based, and in my twelve weeks in the bay area I probably visited San Francisco International Airport about ten times. Evan Yao and I were able to attend the United's 747 Farewell Family Day, through winning a twitter sweepstakes hosted by ThePointsGuy.\nThe last international flight of United's 747 Friend Ship, UA892, landing. October, 2017 That said, there are probably a lot more interesting topics about airplanes. Skift and CAPA provide interesting analysis on the business or product side of the aviation industry. For travel blogs or tips on churning, I defer to FlyerTalk, OneMileAtATime, and ThePointsGuy.\nTo follow airplanes in particular, I use Planespotters to look up airplane inventory. FlightRadar24 is my go to for tracking flights or airplanes. Certain airplanes, such as the Lufthansa 747-8I retrojet (D-ABYT) or the ANA 787-9 Star Wars Jet (JA873A) deserve special attention!\nANA's Star Wars Jet, a Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner. January, 2016 ",

Namely, children do not have intermediary text transcriptions in corresponding visual and audio inputs from the world around them; rather, they directly make connections between what they see and what they hear. In this paper, we construct models for the direct bi-directional classification of speech and images, inspired by a few research papers. We experiment with architectures of two convolutional neural networks, one on the TIDIGITS data set (audio) and the other on the MNIST data set (visual), to obtain joint representations of single digits from spoken utterances and images. Finally, we experiment with an alignment model that ties together the convnets to learn these joint representations. We report an overall image annotation accuracy of 88.5% and an overall image retrieval accuracy of 87.6%.\nLinks \u0026amp; Notes I worked with Sitara Persad and Karan Kashyap on this final project.\nSee our paper writeup here.\nOur GitHub repository for the project is available here.\n",

So how does one meet new people outside of her daily life cycle of classes, clubs, psetting, and her friend group?
